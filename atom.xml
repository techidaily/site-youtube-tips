This article will inform you about all the things you want to know about <strong>AV1 Youtube</strong> settings. I will let you know the tutorial to turn in AV1 settings on YouTube and the reason why should choose AV1 along with the others, and some more things about AV1.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/av1-settings-on-youtube-1.jpg"                      alt="av1 logo"                ></p><blockquote><p> Disclaimer: This post includes affiliate links</p><p> If you click on a link and make a purchase, I may receive a commission at no extra cost to you.</p></blockquote><h2 id="Part-1-How-to-turn-on-AV1-settings-on-YouTube"><a href="#Part-1-How-to-turn-on-AV1-settings-on-YouTube" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: How to turn on AV1 settings on YouTube?"></a>Part 1: How to turn on AV1 settings on YouTube?</h2><p>Do you wonder how to turn on <strong>AV1 settings on YouTube</strong>? For your information, AV1 is a video codec that is developed by a consortium of companies. It offers you advanced compression, enabling you to do smoother HD streaming and data savings for the video. Google also has already implemented AV1 use on YouTube. To turn on AV1 settings on YouTube, here are the steps:</p><h5 id="Step1Go-to-playback-and-performance"><a href="#Step1Go-to-playback-and-performance" class="headerlink" title="Step1Go to playback and performance"></a>Step1Go to playback and performance</h5><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/av1-settings-on-youtube-2.jpg"                      alt="youtube settings"                ></p><ul><li>To turn on the AV1 settings, go to your YouTube account, after that click “Playback and Performance”.</li><li>In the AV1 settings. Besides “Auto (Recommended)”, there are other two options, which are “Prefer AV1 for SD” and also “Always prefer SD”.</li><li>“Always Prefer AV1” uses the codec whenever it is available for a video while “Prefer AV1 for SD” limits it to SD videos. There are two options to avoid low-performance devices when AV1 videos are played on YouTube. You can select “Always Prefer AV1” to see if your device performance is good enough when you play videos on YouTube that support AV1.</li></ul><h5 id="Step2Test-if-the-AV1-settings-are-already-enabled-in-your-video"><a href="#Step2Test-if-the-AV1-settings-are-already-enabled-in-your-video" class="headerlink" title="Step2Test if the AV1 settings are already enabled in your video"></a>Step2Test if the AV1 settings are already enabled in your video</h5><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/av1-settings-on-youtube-3.jpg"                      alt="av1 settings"                ></p><p>You may ask how to confirm your YouTube videos are playing with AV1 Codec. Well, you can search playlist on YouTube with the keywords “<a class="link"   href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLRJRxnLlXbB0ETtMprpLypZs68duRS1t1" >4K, 5K, and 8K videos with the new AV1 Codec <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>“. You can test it by playing one of the videos. You have to right-click on the media player and then select “Stats for nerd”. If it shows the av01 codec there, then the AV1 settings are enabled already.</p><h2 id="Part-2-Why-choose-AV1-over-VP9-and-other-formats"><a href="#Part-2-Why-choose-AV1-over-VP9-and-other-formats" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: Why choose AV1 over VP9 and other formats?"></a>Part 2: Why choose AV1 over VP9 and other formats?</h2><p>Now, do you need a reason why you should choose AV1 compared to VP9 and the others? As you know, there is also another video codec like VP9. There are also the others such as VVC, and many more. So what is the superiority of AV1 over the others? I will let you know why you should choose AV1 in this part.</p><p>The main thing is, as mentioned before, AV1 is developed by a consortium of companies founded in 2015. It is supported by The Alliance for Open Media (AOMedia) such as Amazon, Facebook, Google, Microsoft, and Netflix, and also by web browser developers and semiconductor firms. Aomedia made it clear the algorithm is free-to-use. It means that there are no greedy negotiators that will be dependent on the developers.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/av1-settings-on-youtube-4.jpg"                      alt="giant techs behind av1"                ></p><p>Also, these days, with a format that provides a much smaller workload for internet providers. Their today focus is, that AV1 can reach the quality but can get the job done with 20% more efficiency. Then, with AV1 encoding, a “standard” 4K movie will be much more accessible than it is now. These are some more reasons why you should choose AV1.</p><h3 id="1-Royalty-free"><a href="#1-Royalty-free" class="headerlink" title="1. Royalty-free"></a>1. Royalty-free</h3><p>As mentioned before, AV1 is royalty-free. AV1 is such a next-generation of royalty video codec. It means that it is not just free to use, but also free of charge, obligations, or even liability. It is an open and royalty-free video codec that the video platform will not charge to pay royalties to the Moving Picture Experts Group (MPEG), the developer of video codecs.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/av1-settings-on-youtube-5.jpg"                      alt="av1 is royalty-free"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://imp.i357552.net/c/5597632/994842/11832" target="_top" id="994842">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/11832-994842" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.i357552.net/i/5597632/994842/11832"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p>When it comes to the group that will ask for the royalty, MPEG is not the only one. There are also other patent groups and companies that can ask for it. Aomedia integrated Google, Mozilla, and Cisco, while they were busy creating their new video codec. However, the three companies joined together to create one codec to beat them all.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><span id="1976998">                    <video width="128" height="480" style="cursor:pointer"           poster="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1976998.png"           onclick="if(!this.playClicked){this.play();this.setAttribute('controls',true);this.playClicked=true;}">       <source src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/22993-1976998">       <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1976998.png"                      style="border: none; height: 100%; width: 100%; object-fit: contain"                >    </video>    <div style="width:80px;text-align:center"><a class="link"   href="javascript:window.open(decodeURIComponent('https%3A%2F%2Fhomestyler.sjv.io%2Fc%2F5597632%2F1976998%2F22993'), '_blank');void(0);" >Click here <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></div></span><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1976998/22993"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="2-Better-performance"><a href="#2-Better-performance" class="headerlink" title="2. Better performance"></a>2. Better performance</h3><p>It is said that the AV1 codec is 30% more efficient. According to the tests conducted by Moscow State University, AV1 can outperform AV1 by about 28% in the efficiency of encoding and decoding. As per the performance graph from the Graphics &amp; Media Lab Video Group, MSU below, AV1 can offer the exactly same quality as X264 at 55% of the average bitrate.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/av1-settings-on-youtube-6.jpg"                      alt="av1 benefit"                ></p><p>AV1 is designed so exclusively to function better than all the other codecs in the market. It is an open-sourced codec with simple patent licensing, and the integration manages to save, as mentioned, up to 30% of the bandwidth for the exactly same image quality. In other words, with AV1, distributors can send streams much faster and cheaper and we can enjoy higher definitions in the same bandwidth.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2087395/7443" target="_top" id="2087395">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2087395" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2087395/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="3-AV2-to-come-in-the-future"><a href="#3-AV2-to-come-in-the-future" class="headerlink" title="3.

AV2 to come in the future</h3><p>AV1 is undoubtedly superior if we compare it to other available video codecs and the exploration of the codec technology AV2 has already begun. This is such an early performance evaluation. There is some interesting part of the exploration development of AV2, such as multiple line selection for Intra prediction can make you select not just neighboring row&#x2F;column for directional prediction. The same tool also exists in VVC.</p><p>There are also three essential improvements, which are simplifying the existing feature (also complete removal) and picking the tool used by VVC&#x2F;H.266 (It is lack originality but so much work on it) and improvement periodically improvement of an existing tool, it is too few and also not original. We haven’t known yet when AV2 will be done completely though, maybe there still be some more essential improvements.</p><h2 id="Part-3-What’s-the-best-video-editor-for-YouTubers-with-AV1-format"><a href="#Part-3-What’s-the-best-video-editor-for-YouTubers-with-AV1-format" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: What’s the best video editor for YouTubers with AV1 format?"></a>Part 3: What’s the best video editor for YouTubers with AV1 format?</h2><p>When we talk about YouTube, it feels incomplete if we don’t talk about the video editor.

This article will inform you about all the things you want to know about <strong>AV1 Youtube</strong> settings. I will let you know the tutorial to turn in AV1 settings on YouTube and the reason why should choose AV1 along with the others, and some more things about AV1.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/av1-settings-on-youtube-1.jpg"                      alt="av1 logo"                ></p><blockquote><p> Disclaimer: This post includes affiliate links</p><p> If you click on a link and make a purchase, I may receive a commission at no extra cost to you.</p></blockquote><h2 id="Part-1-How-to-turn-on-AV1-settings-on-YouTube"><a href="#Part-1-How-to-turn-on-AV1-settings-on-YouTube" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: How to turn on AV1 settings on YouTube?"></a>Part 1: How to turn on AV1 settings on YouTube?</h2><p>Do you wonder how to turn on <strong>AV1 settings on YouTube</strong>? For your information, AV1 is a video codec that is developed by a consortium of companies. It offers you advanced compression, enabling you to do smoother HD streaming and data savings for the video. Google also has already implemented AV1 use on YouTube. To turn on AV1 settings on YouTube, here are the steps:</p><h5 id="Step1Go-to-playback-and-performance"><a href="#Step1Go-to-playback-and-performance" class="headerlink" title="Step1Go to playback and performance"></a>Step1Go to playback and performance</h5><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/av1-settings-on-youtube-2.jpg"                      alt="youtube settings"                ></p><ul><li>To turn on the AV1 settings, go to your YouTube account, after that click “Playback and Performance”.</li><li>In the AV1 settings. Besides “Auto (Recommended)”, there are other two options, which are “Prefer AV1 for SD” and also “Always prefer SD”.</li><li>“Always Prefer AV1” uses the codec whenever it is available for a video while “Prefer AV1 for SD” limits it to SD videos. There are two options to avoid low-performance devices when AV1 videos are played on YouTube. You can select “Always Prefer AV1” to see if your device performance is good enough when you play videos on YouTube that support AV1.</li></ul><h5 id="Step2Test-if-the-AV1-settings-are-already-enabled-in-your-video"><a href="#Step2Test-if-the-AV1-settings-are-already-enabled-in-your-video" class="headerlink" title="Step2Test if the AV1 settings are already enabled in your video"></a>Step2Test if the AV1 settings are already enabled in your video</h5><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/av1-settings-on-youtube-3.jpg"                      alt="av1 settings"                ></p><p>You may ask how to confirm your YouTube videos are playing with AV1 Codec. Well, you can search playlist on YouTube with the keywords “<a class="link"   href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLRJRxnLlXbB0ETtMprpLypZs68duRS1t1" >4K, 5K, and 8K videos with the new AV1 Codec <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>“. You can test it by playing one of the videos. You have to right-click on the media player and then select “Stats for nerd”. If it shows the av01 codec there, then the AV1 settings are enabled already.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2118312/7443" target="_top" id="2118312">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2118312" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2118312/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Part-2-Why-choose-AV1-over-VP9-and-other-formats"><a href="#Part-2-Why-choose-AV1-over-VP9-and-other-formats" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: Why choose AV1 over VP9 and other formats?"></a>Part 2: Why choose AV1 over VP9 and other formats?</h2><p>Now, do you need a reason why you should choose AV1 compared to VP9 and the others? As you know, there is also another video codec like VP9. There are also the others such as VVC, and many more. So what is the superiority of AV1 over the others? I will let you know why you should choose AV1 in this part.</p><p>The main thing is, as mentioned before, AV1 is developed by a consortium of companies founded in 2015. It is supported by The Alliance for Open Media (AOMedia) such as Amazon, Facebook, Google, Microsoft, and Netflix, and also by web browser developers and semiconductor firms. Aomedia made it clear the algorithm is free-to-use. It means that there are no greedy negotiators that will be dependent on the developers.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/av1-settings-on-youtube-4.jpg"                      alt="giant techs behind av1"                ></p><p>Also, these days, with a format that provides a much smaller workload for internet providers. Their today focus is, that AV1 can reach the quality but can get the job done with 20% more efficiency. Then, with AV1 encoding, a “standard” 4K movie will be much more accessible than it is now. These are some more reasons why you should choose AV1.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2037335/7443" target="_top" id="2037335">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2037335" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2037335/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="1-Royalty-free"><a href="#1-Royalty-free" class="headerlink" title="1. Royalty-free"></a>1. Royalty-free</h3><p>As mentioned before, AV1 is royalty-free. AV1 is such a next-generation of royalty video codec. It means that it is not just free to use, but also free of charge, obligations, or even liability. It is an open and royalty-free video codec that the video platform will not charge to pay royalties to the Moving Picture Experts Group (MPEG), the developer of video codecs.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/av1-settings-on-youtube-5.jpg"                      alt="av1 is royalty-free"                ></p><p>When it comes to the group that will ask for the royalty, MPEG is not the only one. There are also other patent groups and companies that can ask for it. Aomedia integrated Google, Mozilla, and Cisco, while they were busy creating their new video codec. However, the three companies joined together to create one codec to beat them all.</p><h3 id="2-Better-performance"><a href="#2-Better-performance" class="headerlink" title="2. Better performance"></a>2. Better performance</h3><p>It is said that the AV1 codec is 30% more efficient. According to the tests conducted by Moscow State University, AV1 can outperform AV1 by about 28% in the efficiency of encoding and decoding. As per the performance graph from the Graphics &amp; Media Lab Video Group, MSU below, AV1 can offer the exactly same quality as X264 at 55% of the average bitrate.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/av1-settings-on-youtube-6.jpg"                      alt="av1 benefit"                ></p><p>AV1 is designed so exclusively to function better than all the other codecs in the market. It is an open-sourced codec with simple patent licensing, and the integration manages to save, as mentioned, up to 30% of the bandwidth for the exactly same image quality. In other words, with AV1, distributors can send streams much faster and cheaper and we can enjoy higher definitions in the same bandwidth.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/2135396/19272" target="_top" id="2135396">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-2135396" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="160" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/2135396/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="3-AV2-to-come-in-the-future"><a href="#3-AV2-to-come-in-the-future" class="headerlink" title="3. AV2 to come in the future"></a>3. AV2 to come in the future</h3><p>AV1 is undoubtedly superior if we compare it to other available video codecs and the exploration of the codec technology AV2 has already begun. This is such an early performance evaluation. There is some interesting part of the exploration development of AV2, such as multiple line selection for Intra prediction can make you select not just neighboring row&#x2F;column for directional prediction. The same tool also exists in VVC.</p><p>There are also three essential improvements, which are simplifying the existing feature (also complete removal) and picking the tool used by VVC&#x2F;H.266 (It is lack originality but so much work on it) and improvement periodically improvement of an existing tool, it is too few and also not original. We haven’t known yet when AV2 will be done completely though, maybe there still be some more essential improvements.</p><h2 id="Part-3-What’s-the-best-video-editor-for-YouTubers-with-AV1-format"><a href="#Part-3-What’s-the-best-video-editor-for-YouTubers-with-AV1-format" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: What’s the best video editor for YouTubers with AV1 format?"></a>Part 3: What’s the best video editor for YouTubers with AV1 format?</h2><p>When we talk about YouTube, it feels incomplete if we don’t talk about the video editor.

Post YouTube Videos Consistently"></a>1. Post YouTube Videos Consistently</h2><p>In order to consistently draw viewers back your page and get the most out of your content, you need to be able to <a class="link"   href="https://www.filmora.io/community-blog/how-often-should-you-upload-to-youtube--consistent-posting-gets-views-187.html" >keep posting constantly <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. Only posting sporadically when you feel like it – three times one month, then just once the next – will not encourage viewers to subscribe. If you develop a schedule and regularly post content each week (or every day if you’re really ambitious), your viewers can start to expect when a video will be released. Some of the best content creators will continue to release videos at least a few times a week in order to continuously draw an audience back to their channel.</p><h2 id="2-Provide-Value-in-Each-Video"><a href="#2-Provide-Value-in-Each-Video" class="headerlink" title="2. Provide Value in Each Video"></a>2. Provide Value in Each Video</h2><p>Before you turn your camera on and start making a new video, ask yourself what value you want your viewers to take away from it. Will they come away from your video with knowledge, a new skill, or a feeling of amusement? Be sure to have a clear objective in mind with every video.</p><h2 id="3-Ask-Viewers-to-Subscribe-with-a-‘CTA’"><a href="#3-Ask-Viewers-to-Subscribe-with-a-‘CTA’" class="headerlink" title="3. Ask Viewers to Subscribe with a ‘CTA’"></a>3. Ask Viewers to Subscribe with a ‘CTA’</h2><p>Asking viewers to do anything (like, subscribe, etc.) is called a CTA, or ‘<a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >call to action <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>’. Asking for subscribers is a call to action that needs to be included in every video.</p><p>One of the objectives of every video you produce should be to try and appeal to <a class="link"   href="https://www.filmora.io/community-blog/how-to-convert-viewers-into-subscribers-%28the-easy-way%29-287.html" >brand-new viewers <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> for your page. Something as simple as asking the viewer to subscribe if they liked your video can really help you grow faster. Sometimes people who really love your content still need to be reminded to subscribe. It is important to attract subscribers – not just viewers – in order to make sure that you have reliable, ongoing, support for your videos.</p><h2 id="4-Spend-Time-Building-your-YouTube-Community"><a href="#4-Spend-Time-Building-your-YouTube-Community" class="headerlink" title="4. Spend Time Building your YouTube Community"></a>4. Spend Time Building your YouTube Community</h2><p>YouTube is a large community and consistently interacting with other creators will help you to <a class="link"   href="https://www.filmora.io/community-blog/how-to-grow-your-audience-on-youtube-%E2%80%93-one-proven-282.html" >gain support for your videos <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. It helps a lot if the people in your genre know you. You can watch each other’s videos, give each other constructive feedback, and there may even be opportunities for collaboration.</p><p>Many video creators draw inspiration from each other’s videos and even spend time working with each other and promoting each other’s content. If you consistently comment on someone’s videos, without asking them to check out your channel (most people find this annoying), they will probably decide to go look at your videos too. Eventually, you might even find an opportunity to <a class="link"   href="https://www.filmora.io/community-blog/how-to-make-a-collaboration-video-on-youtube-285.html" >appear in one of their videos <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> or have them appear in one of your videos so that you can each be exposed to new potential viewers.</p><h2 id="5-Set-YouTube-Goals-and-Announce-Them"><a href="#5-Set-YouTube-Goals-and-Announce-Them" class="headerlink" title="5. Set YouTube Goals and Announce Them"></a>5. Set YouTube Goals and Announce Them</h2><p>Setting goals for yourself – i.e. reaching a certain number of subscribers – and letting your viewers know is a great way to meet your goals faster.</p><p>Sharing your goals helps your community feel more engaged and like they are a bigger part of your channel. This can be an excellent marketing tactic. When you share your goals, they become your follower’s goals too and they will help you reach them. Creating a payoff where your subscribers can help you reach 2000 subscribers or 1000 likes on a video can help you accomplish more goals to sustain the longevity of your channel. It also fosters a feeling of community by uniting everyone together and allowing them to share your feeling of accomplishment. This works especially well if you offer a reward – i.e. ‘I’ll do a special video when I reach 2000 subscribers’.</p><p> <em>Contest now closed.</em></p><h2 id="6-Find-a-Niche-for-Your-Videos"><a href="#6-Find-a-Niche-for-Your-Videos" class="headerlink" title="6. Find a Niche for Your Videos"></a>6. Find a Niche for Your Videos</h2><p>Many creators on YouTube have found success by carving out very specific video types and <a class="link"   href="https://www.filmora.io/community-blog/how-to-find-your-niche-on-youtube-%E2%80%93-what%E2%80%99s-the-280.html" >niches <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> for themselves. When you are hoping to grow your subscribers on YouTube you really need to find your niche. When you can start to create videos that have predictable subject matter (predictable in the sense of ‘reliable’, not boring), this will attract more regular viewers because people will know what they can expect from your content. Having a niche can also help you find brand deals because you’ll grow a very specific audience that might be interested in very specific products. A smaller, targeted, the audience can be more valuable to an advertiser than a larger, more general, audience.</p><p>Your niche will generally be a combination of your larger genre (i.e. gaming, comedy, beauty, food) and something else you are passionate about. For example, reviewing vintage video games or creating desserts based on movies are both potential niches.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://ephamedtechinc.pxf.io/c/5597632/2136627/26400" target="_top" id="2136627">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/26400-2136627" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://ephamedtechinc.pxf.io/i/5597632/2136627/26400"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="7-Build-a-Strong-Personal-Brand"><a href="#7-Build-a-Strong-Personal-Brand" class="headerlink" title="7.

Build a Strong Personal Brand</h2><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.filmora.io/community-blog/how-to-build-a-brand-on-youtube-%E2%80%93-what-makes-279.html" >Building a brand on YouTube <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> is one of the best ways to generate a devoted following. Building a brand is very important because it makes you more memorable and familiar to viewers. In order to successfully build a brand, you need to think about the image you are trying to create and the culture you want to create for your community. The values you express, the types of videos you do, the clothes you wear, and your <a class="link"   href="https://www.filmora.io/community-blog/top-5-youtube-channel-art-makers-299.html" >channel art <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> are all parts of your brand. The grand total of all of these elements will form your brand and the way you are perceived.</p><p>Having a strong, unique, the brand will make viewers feel more attached to you and make your content more recognizable.</p><h2 id="8-Create-Custom-Channel-Art"><a href="#8-Create-Custom-Channel-Art" class="headerlink" title="8. Create Custom Channel Art"></a>8. Create Custom Channel Art</h2><p>To differentiate yourself from your competition you’re going to need to have <a class="link"   href="https://www.filmora.io/community-blog/how-to-design-your-youtube-channel-art-2-ways-230.html" >custom Channel Art <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> that reflects the vibe of your content. Work at creating or sourcing some graphics for your cover photo, your profile photo, and all of your thumbnails. Having a set color scheme or even a branded style of artwork for your page will help you to look more professional. Differentiating your page from others will create a feeling of familiarity and support your brand.</p><h2 id="9-Practice-Makes-Perfect"><a href="#9-Practice-Makes-Perfect" class="headerlink" title="9. Practice Makes Perfect"></a>9. Practice Makes Perfect</h2><p>In order to start producing more professional content, you need to practice your filmmaking technique. Regardless of the type of video that you are producing, a little bit of practice goes a long way.</p><p>Rehearsing what you are going to say can make you feel much more confident. Playing with the video editing software that you’re working with will<a class="link"   href="https://www.filmora.io/community-blog/faster-rendering-faster-uploads-and-other-post-production-speed-hacks-211.html" >save you time when you’re actually polishing a video <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. Practicing taking photos and videos with your camera outside of making YouTube videos will help you feel familiar with its features. As you start to get more dedicated and practice with your video creation, your videos will gain more viewers and you can grow more subscribers on YouTube.</p><p>Simply making more videos is a great way to get in more practice.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2137413/7443" target="_top" id="2137413">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2137413" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2137413/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="10-Add-a-YouTube-Intro-Video"><a href="#10-Add-a-YouTube-Intro-Video" class="headerlink" title="10.

Intros capture attention and let viewers know the type of video that they are watching almost immediately. Building a 5-10 second introduction (no longer) with your name or the name of your channel will go a long way to improving the professionalism of your video.</p><p> <em>Contest now closed.</em></p><h2 id="11-Use-Video-Effects-and-Transitions"><a href="#11-Use-Video-Effects-and-Transitions" class="headerlink" title="11. Use Video Effects and Transitions"></a>11. Use Video Effects and Transitions</h2><p>Adding transitions between clips or topics is a great way to keep viewers engaged with your videos.</p><p>Using simple color effects, like filters, can help each of your videos look much more professional.</p><p>It can take some time to <a class="link"   href="https://www.filmora.io/community-blog/how-to-edit-a-youtube-video-and-get-more-subscribers-281.html" >add these kinds of effects to your videos <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, but it isn’t really very difficult (many editors, including Filmora, let you drag and drop these effects into your timeline) and it will help your videos hold viewers’ attention for longer. It can also garner much more engagement and many more subscriptions for your YouTube channel.</p><h2 id="12-Make-Eye-Catching-Thumbnails"><a href="#12-Make-Eye-Catching-Thumbnails" class="headerlink" title="12. Make Eye-Catching Thumbnails"></a>12. Make Eye-Catching Thumbnails</h2><p>A thumbnail that grabs a viewer’s attention will get more clicks. Take a photo of yourself making an expression relevant to your video and edit the image in Photoshop or using a free service like Canva (<a class="link"   href="https://www.filmora.io/community-blog/top-10-youtube-thumbnail-makers---easy-to-use%21-312.html" >or one of these other YouTube thumbnail makers <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>). Add graphics, like emojis, to give your thumbnail a pop of color and include large, simple, text if you feel like your thumbnail needs to be given context (i.e. ‘fall makeup look’, as opposed to just another makeup video).</p><h2 id="13-Use-Lots-of-YouTube-Tags"><a href="#13-Use-Lots-of-YouTube-Tags" class="headerlink" title="13. Use Lots of YouTube Tags"></a>13. Use Lots of YouTube Tags</h2><p>Tags are essential to helping people actually find your videos on YouTube. <a class="link"   href="https://www.filmora.io/community-blog/4-steps-to-rank-higher-in-youtube%E2%80%99s-search-results-277.html" >Tags should include keywords&#x2F;search terms <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> people might be looking up in order to find videos like yours. Looking at the tags of some of your past videos and seeing how well they performed will give you an idea of what kinds of tags you should target in the future. Looking at the tags of some of your competitors will give you an idea of what tags you should be using for your own videos.</p><p>Services like the Google Keyword Planner can also help you with finding new keywords&#x2F;tags. Making your tags with search engine optimization in mind will help ensure that people can find your video when searching for those specific keywords. YouTube has an algorithm very similar to the Google search engine for helping people locate videos they may be interested in.</p><h2 id="14-Use-YouTube-Playlists-to-Increase-Watch-Time"><a href="#14-Use-YouTube-Playlists-to-Increase-Watch-Time" class="headerlink" title="14. Use YouTube Playlists to Increase Watch Time"></a>14.

However, there is a workaround where you can use a web browser on your smartphone to get this done. The process that is given below explains how to view your past YouTube comments on an iPhone:</p><p><strong>Step 1: Sign In to Your YouTube Account on an Internet Browser</strong></p><p>Launch your favorite web browser on your iPhone (Safari, the default one, is used here for illustration), go to <a class="link"   href="https://m.youtube.com/" >https://m.youtube.com <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, tap the profile icon from the top-right corner, tap <strong>Sign in</strong> from the menu that appears, and follow the on-screen instructions to use your Google account credentials to sign in to YouTube.</p><p><strong>Step 2: Access the Desktop Version of YouTube</strong></p><p>Tap the <strong>More Options</strong> icon from the top-left corner of the browser, and then tap <strong>Request Desktop Website</strong> from the menu that appears to access the desktop version of YouTube on your iPhone.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/request-desktop-website-youtube.jpg"                      alt="Access the Desktop Version of YouTube "                ></p><p><strong>Step 3: View Your Past YouTube Comments</strong></p><p>Tap the <strong>Menu</strong> icon from the top-left corner of the YouTube page, and tap <strong>History</strong> from the menu that appears.

Find Your YouTube Comments on an Android Smartphone</h3><p>As it is with iOS, the YouTube app for Android doesn’t allow you to view your comments history either. However, the workaround of using a web browser works pretty well on Android smartphones too, but with a few tweaks. The process of doing so is given below:</p><p><strong>Step 1: Use a Web Browser to Sign In to Your YouTube Account</strong></p><p>Launch <strong>Google Chrome</strong> on your Android smartphone (you can use any other web browser of your choice), and go to <a class="link"   href="https://m.youtube.com/" >https://m.youtube.com <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. Notice how the interface automatically changes to the desktop version. <strong>Note:</strong> If the desktop version of the website isn’t visible, you can tap the <strong>More</strong> button (with three vertical dots) from the top-right corner of the browser, and check the <strong>Desktop site</strong> box.</p><p>Next, tap <strong>SIGN IN</strong> from the top-right corner of the YouTube page, enter your Google account credentials in the box available on the <strong>Sign in</strong> screen, enter your password when prompted, and sign in to your YouTube account.</p><p><strong>Step 2: Choose a Web Browser (for Confirmation)</strong></p><p>When the confirmation box pops up at the bottom, choose your preferred web browser, and tap the frequency of its usage for accessing YouTube. For instance, choose <strong>Chrome</strong> and <strong>Just once</strong> to use <strong>Google Chrome</strong> to access YouTube only for this session.</p><p><strong>Step 3: View&#x2F;Access Your Past YouTube Comments</strong></p><p>Once you are signed in to your account, tap the <strong>Menu</strong> icon from the top-left corner of the YouTube page, and tap <strong>History</strong> from the menu that appears. When the <strong>History</strong> page opens up, tap <strong>Comments</strong> from the right pane to view and&#x2F;or access your past YouTube comments.</p><h2 id="Part-2-How-to-Find-All-YouTube-Comments-Your-Channel-Has-Received"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-Find-All-YouTube-Comments-Your-Channel-Has-Received" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: How to Find All YouTube Comments Your Channel Has Received?"></a>Part 2: How to Find All YouTube Comments Your Channel Has Received?</h2><p>If you own a YouTube channel and have posted several videos there, it is likely that you also have received a decent number of comments. Usually, these remarks are pretty helpful as they tell you how to improve your production quality, and what your audience prefers to watch in the future. Therefore, it is imperative to learn how to find all the comments that your YouTube channel has received, and the process given below explains exactly that:</p><h3 id="1-Find-Your-Channel’s-YouTube-Comments-on-a-Desktop-or-Laptop-Computer"><a href="#1-Find-Your-Channel’s-YouTube-Comments-on-a-Desktop-or-Laptop-Computer" class="headerlink" title="1. Find Your Channel’s YouTube Comments on a Desktop or Laptop Computer"></a>1. Find Your Channel’s YouTube Comments on a Desktop or Laptop Computer</h3><p>You can use your favorite web browser on a PC to easily find all the comments that the videos on your YouTube channel have received as long as you are signed in to your Google account. The step-by-step instructions on how this can be done are given below:</p><p><strong>Step 1: Go to the Your videos Page</strong></p><p>Open your favorite Internet browser, go to <a class="link"   href="https://www.youtube.com/" >https://www.youtube.com <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, and sign in to your YouTube account as explained in the previous sections. Next, click the <strong>Menu</strong> icon from the top-left corner of the YouTube homepage, and click <strong>Your videos</strong> from the menu that appears.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/youtube-your-videos-menu.jpg"                      alt="Access  YouTube Your videos Page "                ></p><p><strong>Step 2: View the Comments</strong></p><p>Make sure that the <strong>Uploads</strong> tab is selected on the <strong>Channel content</strong> window, and check the number under the <strong>Comments</strong> column of each video to see how many comments that particular film has received. You can click the number for any video to view its comments.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/find-youtube-video-comments-list.jpg"                      alt="Find  YouTube Comments List "                ></p><p><strong>Step 3: Hide or Hold a Comment for Approval</strong></p><p>Click the <strong>More</strong> icon from the right of the comment you want to moderate, and click <strong>Hide user from channel</strong> or <strong>Always approve comments from this user</strong> to hide the comments from the selected user or keep their comments on hold until you review and approve them respectively.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/set-up-specific-user-comment-moderation.jpg"                      alt="Find  YouTube Comments List "                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2037345/7443" target="_top" id="2037345">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2037345" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2037345/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p>Note: To view all comments received on your YouTube channel, go to the Comments tab under YouTube Studio, and you will find all Channel comments &amp; mentions.</p><h3 id="2-Find-Your-Channel’s-YouTube-Comments-on-a-Mobile-App"><a href="#2-Find-Your-Channel’s-YouTube-Comments-on-a-Mobile-App" class="headerlink" title="2. Find Your Channel’s YouTube Comments on a Mobile App"></a>2. Find Your Channel’s YouTube Comments on a Mobile App</h3><p>This process is comparatively simpler than the previous one as all that you need to do is download the YT Studio app, and access a central location where all the comments for all the videos can be viewed. The process is given below:</p><p><strong>Step 1: Obtain a Mobile App</strong></p><p>Go to <strong>App Store</strong> or <strong>Google Play Store</strong>, and search and download the <strong>YT Studio</strong> app on your iPhone or Android smartphone (iPhone X is used here for illustration).</p><p><strong>Step 2: View&#x2F;Access All the Comments</strong></p><p>Launch the <strong>YT Studio</strong> app, and sign in to your YouTube account. Tap the <strong>Menu</strong> icon from the top-left corner of the interface, and tap <strong>Comments</strong> from the menu to view all the published comments for all the videos that you have received on your YouTube channel.</p><p><strong>Step 3: Hide Users and View Held Comments</strong></p><p>Tap the <strong>More</strong> button from the right of an inappropriate comment, and tap <strong>Hide user from channel</strong> from the menu that comes up. In addition, you can tap the <strong>More</strong> button next to <strong>Published</strong> from the top, and tap <strong>Held for review</strong> from the box that pops up to view the comments that are waiting for your approval.</p><p><strong>Note:</strong> Unfortunately, you cannot hold the comments for approval using the YT Studio app. As a workaround, you can follow the procedure given earlier to access the desktop version of YouTube on your smartphone, and then use the method explained in the previous section to get this done. However, it is recommended that you do all such sensitive tasks on a laptop or desktop computer to avoid any errors.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/find-youtube-channel-comments-mobile.jpg"                      alt="Find  YouTube Comments mobile "                ></p><h2 id="Part-3-Find-Someone’s-YouTube-Comments-by-User-Name"><a href="#Part-3-Find-Someone’s-YouTube-Comments-by-User-Name" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: Find Someone’s YouTube Comments by User Name"></a>Part 3: Find Someone’s YouTube Comments by User Name</h2><p>If any of your YouTube videos has thousands of comments and you need to find a particular one from a specific user, checking each remark manually would be an extremely time-consuming and tedious task. Therefore, it is a good idea to let an efficient application do the job for you.</p><p>One program, a Google Chrome extension called YCS – YouTube Comment Search to be precise, can help you with this.

Therefore, you might want to moderate all your comments before they become visible to the audience so as not to spread negativity among the mass. Fortunately, YouTube helps you get this done easily, and the instructions that teach you the process are given below:</p><p><strong>Step 1: Get to Your Channel’s Settings Box</strong></p><p>Sign in to your YouTube account, click the <strong>Menu</strong> icon from the top-left corner of the homepage, and click <strong>Your videos</strong> from the menu that appears.</p><p>From the bottom of the navigation bar on the left of the <strong>YouTube Studio</strong> page, click <strong>Settings</strong> to open the channel’s <strong>Settings</strong> box.</p><p><strong>Step 2: Moderate YouTube Comments</strong></p><p>Go to the <strong>Community</strong> category from the left pane, and go to the <strong>Defaults</strong> tab from the right. Next, choose <strong>Hide all comments for review</strong> from the <strong>Comments on your new videos</strong> drop-down list, and click <strong>SAVE</strong> from the bottom-right corner of the box to moderate all YouTube comments that your new videos receive from this point onward.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/set-up-youtube-community-comments-moderaiton.jpg"                      alt="set  YouTube Community Comments moderation "                ></p><h2 id="Part-6-Tips-for-Writing-Good-YouTube-Comments"><a href="#Part-6-Tips-for-Writing-Good-YouTube-Comments" class="headerlink" title="Part 6: Tips for Writing Good YouTube Comments"></a>Part 6: Tips for Writing Good YouTube Comments</h2><p>While posting a comment on a YouTube video, it is imperative to keep a few things in mind. Some important tips that might come in handy in this regard are suggested below:</p><ul><li>Make your comment as relevant to the video as you possibly can</li><li>Avoid using harsh language or slangs to maintain decency</li><li>Be genuine while leaving feedback. However, make sure to choose polite words while typing a comment</li><li>In case you want to add some suggestions, make sure to be humble</li><li>Ignore the replies with inappropriate content</li></ul><h2 id="FAQs-About-YouTube-Comments"><a href="#FAQs-About-YouTube-Comments" class="headerlink" title="FAQs About YouTube Comments"></a>FAQs About YouTube Comments</h2><p><strong>Q1) Why can’t I see the comments I posted?</strong></p><p><strong>A:</strong> If you cannot see your comments, this could be because the owner or moderator has configured the channel or the video to hold all the comments for review before they are visible on YouTube.</p><p>In such a case, you are advised to wait for the authorized person to approve your remark before it is published. Another possibility is that the moderator&#x2F;owner has added you to the ‘hidden users’ list due to some reason. Even in this case, your comment won’t be visible until you are removed from that list.</p><p><strong>Q2) I have enabled</strong> <strong>‘Notify me’ about comments and other activity on my channel or videos, but can’t see the comments on my video. Why?</strong></p><p><strong>A:</strong> You won’t be able to view the unpublished comments or those from the users you have added to the ‘hidden’ list. To fix this problem, you may want to disable moderation from your channel or the videos, and also unhide the users. The processes of both these configurations are explained in detail in the above sections.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/richard-bennett.jpg"                      alt="author avatar"                ></p><p>Richard Bennett</p><p>Richard Bennett is a writer and a lover of all things video.</p><p>Follow @Richard Bennett</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://youtube-tips.techidaily.com/ecoding-the-marketplace-where-to-invest-in-monetized-channels-for-2024/"><u>[New] Decoding the Marketplace Where to Invest in Monetized Channels for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-tips.techidaily.com/armonizing-hues-in-online-beauty-videos/"><u>[New] Harmonizing Hues in Online Beauty Videos</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-tips.techidaily.com/n-2024-top-listings-of-youtube-partner-opportunities-and-advertisements/"><u>[New] In 2024, Top Listings of YouTube Partner Opportunities and Advertisements</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-links.techidaily.com/updated-creating-stunning-time-lapses-using-gopro-studio/"><u>[Updated] Creating Stunning Time Lapses Using GoPro Studio</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-tips.techidaily.com/ed-learn-from-the-best-youtubes-top-green-screen-techniques-for-2024/"><u>[Updated] Learn From The Best Youtube’s Top Green Screen Techniques for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-tips.techidaily.com/ed-rush-towards-a-millennium-of-channel-supporters-for-2024/"><u>[Updated] Rush Towards a Millennium of Channel Supporters for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://screen-mirroring-recording.techidaily.com/updated-zoom-for-the-first-timer-easy-to-follow-guidelines/"><u>[Updated] Zoom for the First Timer Easy-to-Follow Guidelines</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-webster.techidaily.com/approved-explore-and-compare-20plus-best-free-video-editors-for-ios/"><u>2024 Approved Explore and Compare 20+ Best Free Video Editors for iOS</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-skills.techidaily.com/2024-approved-navigating-google-photos-like-a-pro/"><u>2024 Approved Navigating Google Photos Like a Pro</u></a></li><li><a href="https://android-pokemon-go.techidaily.com/4-solution-to-get-rid-of-pokemon-fail-to-detect-location-on-oppo-find-x6-pro-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/"><u>4 solution to get rid of pokemon fail to detect location On Oppo Find X6 Pro | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-tips.techidaily.com/ing-compelling-thumbnails-for-your-youtube-content/"><u>Crafting Compelling Thumbnails for Your YouTube Content</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-http.techidaily.com/crafting-your-path-to-optimal-hdr-camera-selection/"><u>Crafting Your Path to Optimal HDR Camera Selection</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-blog.techidaily.com/ng-strategies-for-successful-youtube-shorts-must-haves-earnings-prospects-for-2024/"><u>Earning Strategies for Successful Youtube Shorts Must-Haves, Earnings Prospects for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://easy-unlock-android.techidaily.com/in-2024-how-to-unlock-a-poco-f5-5g-easily-by-drfone-android/"><u>In 2024, How To Unlock a Poco F5 5G Easily?</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-tips.techidaily.com/24-unleash-potential-optimizing-short-films-in-marketing/"><u>In 2024, Unleash Potential Optimizing Short Films in Marketing</u></a></li><li><a href="https://phone-solutions.techidaily.com/in-2024-wondering-the-best-alternative-to-hola-on-vivo-v29-pro-here-is-the-answer-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/"><u>In 2024, Wondering the Best Alternative to Hola On Vivo V29 Pro?

Use YouTube’s Auto-Suggest Tool to Get Tags"></a>1. Use YouTube’s Auto-Suggest Tool to Get Tags</h3><p>YouTube’s search engine can be your best ally on the quest for great tags. This tool was created to aid users who are looking for content on the platform, and content creators can benefit from it as well. By typing the general topic of your video, or a few words vaguely related to your video, into the search bar on YouTube you can see suggestions that reflect what viewers are searching for and take some of those suggestions into consideration for your tags. With every new phrase (and even every additional character you type), new options will appear. By playing around with this tool you will gain valuable insight into the searching habits of YouTube viewers.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/find-youtube-tag-by-searching.jpg"                      alt=" Find YouTube Video Tag"                ></p><p>This method may not be too precise, but the idea is to quickly gather information and perhaps get some inspiration for more creative or complex tags. Most of the suggestions will be logical, but there can be a few unexpected combinations you’d never think of. Be very careful when translating the findings to your own situation, since the fact that some terms are popular doesn’t mean they are relevant for your video. Another problem is that slightly altered terminology can significantly change the effectiveness of the tag, so you should ideally use the suggested phrases in the exact form as you found them or not at all. If you do make adjustments, you should test the new tag through the same auto-complete tool and see how it fares.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/1902309/19272" target="_top" id="1902309">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-1902309" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/1902309/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="2-Try-YouTube-Tag-Generators"><a href="#2-Try-YouTube-Tag-Generators" class="headerlink" title="2.

The keyword list is based on YouTube’s search tool in a way similar to what we described in the previous chapter. However, since the analysis is automated with the Keyword Tool, you can get a huge list in just a few seconds. This generator is especially useful when you are looking for long-tail keywords that attract niche audiences.</p><h4 id="2-Rapid-Tags"><a href="#2-Rapid-Tags" class="headerlink" title="#2.

It’s completely automated, so you won’t have to do any heavy lifting on your own. Just type the URL of your video into the appropriate field and let Rapid Tags do the rest. You can easily switch between the Generator, Analyzer, Ranker, and Tracker tools, so you can acquire a complete picture of the suitability of each tag and a better understanding of the projected performance of your video.</p><p>Want more tools to generate YouTube tags?

It can suggest suitable tags for your new video based on the main keyword you provide, speeding up your research considerably. It can also analyze the tags placed on an existing YouTube video, which is important for deducing how other authors working in the same category are optimizing their content.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2118319/7443" target="_top" id="2118319">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2118319" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2118319/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="3-Study-Your-YouTube-Rivals’-Tags"><a href="#3-Study-Your-YouTube-Rivals’-Tags" class="headerlink" title="3.

No matter what your videos are about, there are probably countless other creators that want to attract the same audiences as you.

The first 15 seconds of a video is when viewers are most likely to decide to click on one of the recommended videos, or go back to their search results and choose something else. The odds of them leaving within these first 15 seconds are greater if you do not get right to the main point of your video. That is why long intro sequences are bad for your watch time.</p><p>Whether it is better to put your intro at the very beginning of your video, or after you introduce your topic, will depend on your viewers. You may want to try it both ways and then look at your retention report (found in your YouTube Creator Studio under Analytics) to see which works best for you.</p><h4 id="Top-Intro-Sites"><a href="#Top-Intro-Sites" class="headerlink" title="Top Intro Sites"></a><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Top Intro Sites <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h4><p>There are a few different sites where you can download animated intros, customized to include your username or logo. Here are two of the best:</p><p><strong>FlixPress.com</strong></p><p>This is probably the most popular intro site. There are a lot of great animated intros available for under $5, or even for free.</p><p><strong>IntroMaker.net</strong></p><p>This is another site with really professional looking intros for $5. They only have two free options, though.</p><h4 id="Creating-an-Intro-in-Filmora"><a href="#Creating-an-Intro-in-Filmora" class="headerlink" title="Creating an Intro in Filmora"></a>Creating an Intro in Filmora</h4><p>You can create a simple intro card in <strong>Filmora</strong>.</p><p><a href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-win.jpg"                      alt="Download Win Version"                > </a> <a href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-mac.jpg"                      alt="Download Mac Version"                > </a></p><ol><li>Choose your background.

In the pop-up, select the background of your logo to make it transparent. For this to work your logo cannot be the same color as its background.</li><li>Click on the editing icon with your logo selected and choose an animation.</li><li>Go to the Text&#x2F;Titles menu and choose an animated title that suits your channel. Drag it into your text track and edit it to include your name.</li><li>The last piece of your intro is sound. You can choose a song from Filmora’s library and cut it down to five seconds, or import your sound effect.</li><li>Export your video and save it for use in all of your other videos.</li></ol><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://laganoo.pxf.io/c/5597632/1528681/16446" target="_top" id="1528681">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/16446-1528681" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="300" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://laganoo.pxf.io/i/5597632/1528681/16446"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Part-2-End-Cards"><a href="#Part-2-End-Cards" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: End Cards"></a>Part 2: End Cards</h2><p>When your video ends, YouTube will recommend a selection of videos users may want to watch next. Often, these recommendations will not include more of your videos.</p><p>To keep viewers on your channel, you can create your End Card which recommends other content you have created.</p><h4 id="Elements-of-an-End-Card"><a href="#Elements-of-an-End-Card" class="headerlink" title="Elements of an End Card"></a>Elements of an End Card</h4><p>An end card includes clips from two or three of your videos, muted, and shrunk down to thumbnail-size. Using spotlight annotations you can make these thumbnails click-able.</p><p>It is also important that your end card includes multiple calls to action. A call to action is meant to spur a viewer to some kind of action. Writing ‘Check out this video’ above one of your thumbnails is a call to action.</p><p>You should also have a subscribe link somewhere in your end card, ideally a very noticeable button with a proven call to action like ‘Subscribe Now!’.</p><p>Some creators will leave their end cards at that and play music overtop, but it can be even more effective to include a voiceover where you ask viewers to subscribe and watch your other videos.</p><h4 id="How-To-Make-an-End-Card"><a href="#How-To-Make-an-End-Card" class="headerlink" title="How To Make an End Card"></a><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >How To Make an End Card <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h4><ol><li>Choose a static background. You may want to download an end card template or create one in a drawing program. If you do, make sure to include calls to action like ‘Watch more!’ and ‘Subscribe’.</li><li>Drag your background into your timeline at the end of your video.</li><li>Import two or three of your previous videos and drag them into your picture in picture tracks.

That doesn’t mean you have to take out a loan and spend thousands to purchase a brand new camera and all other gadgets that professional filmmakers use.</p><p>The smartest way to get started is to go through a list of <strong>necessary equipment for YouTube</strong> and check whether or not you already own some of it. Once your channel starts growing, you can then start thinking about whether you want to invest in upgraded equipment. Here is a quick overview of all items that you need to start entertaining your online audience and gaining subscribers to your YouTube channel:</p><ul><li><a href="#camera">Your YouTube Camera</a></li><li><a href="#mic">Microphones and Audio</a></li><li><a href="#light">Lighting Gear for YouTube</a></li><li><a href="#tripod">Tripods and Camera Stands</a></li><li><a href="#phone">Smartphone Camera Gear</a></li></ul><blockquote><p> Disclaimer: This post includes affiliate links</p><p> If you click on a link and make a purchase, I may receive a commission at no extra cost to you.</p></blockquote><h2 id="YouTube-Cameras"><a href="#YouTube-Cameras" class="headerlink" title="YouTube Cameras"></a>YouTube Cameras</h2><p><strong>The short version:</strong> Use whatever you already have, even if it’s your phone or webcam. It’s nice to have sharp, fine-tuned, 4K footage, but viewers will forgive lower visual quality if your content is good.</p><p><strong>The long version: You</strong> will need a camera, but there are a lot of different devices you can use including DSLRs, point and shoots, webcams, and your smartphone.</p><p>Your choice of camera will have a tremendous impact on the visual quality of your content and might drive your decisions regarding other pieces of equipment. However, you shouldn’t feel obliged to work with a top-notch camera from day one, especially since cheaper options can produce great results if used the right way.</p><p>On one end of the spectrum, you have basic smartphone cameras and web cameras, which are easy to come by and simple to operate. These days, high-end phones come equipped with quite powerful cameras that are more than sufficient for the needs of the average YouTuber. Better webcams can also do the job, although high-performance webcam models can get pretty expensive too. It is probably wise to resist the urge to start broadcasting with the built-in camera in your laptop and at least get a webcam or use your phone, but your computer’s camera is still always an option. Not having a better camera should never stop you from making YouTube videos.</p><p>If you already have a DSLR camera then it’s a good idea to familiarize yourself with it. You have far more freedom to adjust the settings and achieve a professional look for your videos with a DSLR, but that does mean it’ll take some time to become an expert at using it. Ultra-high resolution is not required for YouTube, but it certainly won’t hurt to have additional sharpness and more detail in the scene. If you’re shopping for a DSLR, look for one with a flip screen that allows you to quickly check what your viewers see.</p><h2 id="YouTube-Microphone-and-Audio"><a href="#YouTube-Microphone-and-Audio" class="headerlink" title="YouTube Microphone and Audio"></a>YouTube Microphone and Audio</h2><p><strong>The short version:</strong> Audio quality is extremely important. If you can buy either a new camera or an external microphone, but not both, it might be better to go for the microphone. <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Click here for advice on upping your audio quality without an external microphone. <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p><strong>The long version:</strong> Sound capturing is every bit as important for your success as your video feed. In fact, poor audio can be even more damaging to your subscriber count than grainy video, since people won’t spend their time listening to something they have to put effort into understanding.</p><p>Again, most YouTube video makers have a limited budget at their disposal, so professional microphones are mostly off the table. However, investing in a directional microphone (‘shotgun mic’) that can pick up your voice clearly and without background noise is certainly a smart move. Such microphones can be pointed towards you while you speak, and since most YouTubers sit still while doing their shows there won’t be too much need for in-session adjustments.</p><p>If you’re not ready to invest in a shotgun mic, you can also find very inexpensive (often under $20) LAV mics. These small microphones can be pinned to your shirt, which allows them to record very clear dialogue because they’re so close to your mouth.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://homestyler.sjv.io/c/5597632/1943648/22993" target="_top" id="1943648">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/22993-1943648" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="300" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://homestyler.sjv.io/i/5597632/1943648/22993"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Lights-for-YouTube"><a href="#Lights-for-YouTube" class="headerlink" title="Lights for YouTube"></a>Lights for YouTube</h2><p><strong>The short version:</strong> You need as much light as you can get. Lighting kits can be affordable on Amazon, but you can also achieve a great look using daylight&#x2F;windows and ‘daylight’ lightbulbs.</p><p><strong>The long version:</strong> If you’ve ever tried to make a video indoors, you already know that it’s necessary to have additional light. Often just filming with the normal lights in a room will cause your footage to look dark and grainy, and possibly be tinted orange. To overcome these problems you need to increase the amount of light you have available.</p><p>Sometimes, it is enough to film near windows and&#x2F;or bring more household lamps into your filming area. For any household lamps or lighting fixtures you use, make sure to put in white or ‘daylight’ lightbulbs instead of using the orange&#x2F;tungsten bulbs that you might have for everyday use (this is how you avoid tinting things orange).</p><p>If you have the budget available to get some lighting equipment, you can find softbox lights or LED panel lights available fairly inexpensively online. Softbox lights are great because they provide even, diffused, light.</p><p>Another useful piece of lighting equipment to have is a reflector. A reflector is usually a piece of white, silver, or gold fabric stretched over a frame. You can use it to bounce light from one light source back towards yourself (this is a great way to fill shadows cast by your main light). Reflectors tend to be inexpensive, but you can also use white cardboard or tinfoil in place of purchasing a reflector.</p><h2 id="Tripods-and-Camera-Stands"><a href="#Tripods-and-Camera-Stands" class="headerlink" title="Tripods and Camera Stands"></a>Tripods and Camera Stands</h2><p><strong>The short version:</strong> You need something to hold your camera. If you mostly film in your own home that can be a desk or a stack of books, but if you make a lot of videos while you’re on the go you probably need a tripod or gimbal. Heavier cameras need heavier tripods.</p><p><strong>The long version:</strong> While handheld cameras can deliver solid results for vloggers and casual streamers, viewers do expect reasonably stable footage. For many types of videos, the camera needs to be completely still and flatly positioned on a horizontal plane. Tripods and camera stands can cost very little, so it’s a good idea to look into getting some kind of stabilizer.</p><p>When you are choosing a tripod, pay attention to how much it weighs. If the camera that needs to be mounted on it is very heavy (like some DSLR models), you want to ensure that the structure itself weighs enough not to be easily tipped over. Too thin tripods can put your camera at risk, and that’s the last thing you want. Smaller cameras such as GoPros are more flexible in this regard and can be placed on a wider range of tripods.</p><p>Even if you are using a phone or a webcam to record YouTube videos, you should consider mounting the device on a stable stand. It is possible to find mini tripods ideal for smartphones for as little as $10. These tripods are small enough to carry in your pocket, so you will be prepared to start making a video no matter where your adventures take you. If you are using a web camera, you should attach it to the stand so that it won’t move accidentally after you touch the surface it is placed on.</p><h2 id="Smartphone-Camera-Gear"><a href="#Smartphone-Camera-Gear" class="headerlink" title="Smartphone Camera Gear"></a>Smartphone Camera Gear</h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/smartphone-camera-gear.jpg"                      alt="Smartphone Camera Gear"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/1938698/19272" target="_top" id="1938698">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-1938698" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/1938698/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p><strong>The short version:</strong> There’s a lot of gear out there designed with smartphone photos and videos in mind, including clip-on lenses, tripod mounts, phone-mounted LED lights, and inexpensive microphones that plug into the audio jack.</p><p><strong>The long version:</strong> Recording your videos with a mobile phone can be a good decision. It all depends on the phone you have and the range of add-ons and apps that you complement it with. Almost every high-end model released in the past five years can shoot videos in 1080p or higher. Some can even produce 4K footage. If you perfect your smartphone filming technique, your YouTube videos could look as if they were made with pro equipment.</p><p>On the flip side, smartphone cameras typically perform poorly in low light. It is possible to download an app that lets you play around with settings to overcome this, but a phone-mounted LED light is probably a better solution. An external microphone might also be a necessity, but there are some good (inexpensive) options that can simply be plugged in through the headphone jack.</p><p>Another common downside of smartphone cameras is that most of them use digital zoom, which is vastly inferior to optical zoom. If you intend to shoot anything that’s further away than a few feet, you need a clip-on lens that goes on top of the built-in camera. This inexpensive device will give you a lot of freedom to work in space, and allow you to make spectacular shots even without high-end YouTube equipment.</p><h2

Picking a YouTube Channel Name"></a>1. <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Picking a YouTube Channel Name <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h3><p>A YouTube channel name is beneficial to your channel’s growth if selected strategically. It can separate you from all the other channels on the platform, it can help the viewers understand what your channel is all about, and it will represent you and your brand. When naming your channel, here are 3 things to remember:</p><ul><li><strong>Memorable</strong>: You’d want a name that sticks in people’s brains. Picking a name that is hard to forget will be a huge advantage for you while growing your channel. But what makes a name memorable?</li><li><strong>Alliteration and assonance</strong>: By using the repetition of consonant or vowel sounds, you create a fluidity to the name. examples: Pewdiepie, GoPro, or League of Legend.</li><li><strong>Fun to say</strong>: Some words stay in the brain because it is simply pleasurable to say. It could have a genuine meaning or it can be an abstract word. Commonly these names have one of these sharp, biting consonants: C, K, Q, X, or Z. examples: Markiplier, Kwebbelkop, Squeezie, and Vox.</li><li><strong>Abbreviations</strong>: A name can have a greater meaning, but long names might not be catchy, therefore, you should abbreviate it to a few memorable letters. Examples: TED ED, TGFbro, ERB, and FBE.</li><li><strong>Longer Phrases</strong>: You may think that having a long name may be hard to remember, but sometimes, depending on your channel, a snappy phrase works. Example: How It Should Have Ended, You Always Win, and People Are Awesome.</li><li><strong>Your Name Plus Descriptor</strong>: Combining two words effectively can make a name more memorable like Markiplier (Mark + Multiplier), LaurDIY (Lauren and she makes DIY projects), and Shameless Maya (Maya and she’s shameless).</li><li><strong>Unique</strong>: Be creative with your name, especially if your real name is generic. YouTube is a crowded space and if you simply call your channel: Jake, not only will you be competing with all the creators named Jake, but also all the content with Jake as the keywords.</li></ul><p>Also, avoid generic names that are based around your channel topics. For example, Fashion Talk sounds like a good name, but if you do a quick search you will see that it is a crowded space with vloggers, keynote presentations, and product reviews.</p><p>If you are starting a fashion channel why not try to find a link between your name and the topic? The connection between two different things often spawns something creative: Fabric Feud, for example. Just by the name, I know this channel will contain interesting perspectives on garments.</p><ul><li><strong>Keep it Simple</strong>: In the end, simplicity is the way to go. Don’t make it hard to type or hard to remember:   <em>cantunderstandthistopic88768</em>  is not a good name, even if it’s strange and cryptic.</li></ul><p>If you have a simple name in mind, it’s also a good idea to do a quick search on YouTube and Google to make sure it isn’t already used or similar to another account. Additionally, it’s worth knowing whether the social media handle is available as you will need it to expand your channel.</p><p>Consider using your real full name, it’s unlikely to ever change. Many YouTubers start out with a stage name but end up growing out of it and simply using their real name later on in their journey.</p><p>We’ve summarized some creative ways of picking up a YouTube name, you can check our guide to <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >picking YouTube Channel Name [4 Aspects]  <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><h3 id="2-Writing-a-YouTube-Channel-Description"><a href="#2-Writing-a-YouTube-Channel-Description" class="headerlink" title="2. Writing a YouTube Channel Description"></a>2. Writing a YouTube Channel Description</h3><p>YouTube is a search engine and the channel description can be treated much like an About page for a website. That is why keywords are important when composing the channel description.</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >What are YouTube SEO keywords? <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>Keywords are the words and phrases people use when they are typing into the search engine to find content. Without the right keywords, your audience may never find your videos.</p><p>If you want to start discovering new keywords for your YouTube channel, you can use <a class="link"   href="https://neilpatel.com/ubersuggest/" >Ubersuggest <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. This tool shows you the search volume (how frequently it is searched for) as well as how competitive (how many other channels are using it) the keyword is.</p><p>Heighten your chance of discoverability by putting keywords as close to the beginning of the description as possible. Later on in this post, we will go through how to properly conduct a keyword strategy. Hang tight.</p><p>In addition to keywords, you should also introduce who you are and what the channel is about. Give them a reason to care about your channel, how is it different than all the other ones on YouTube? Why are you the best person to be producing the content on your channel?</p><p>Then encourage the viewers to subscribe if they are interested in what the channel offers: education, entertainment, adventure, or something they can’t get anywhere else. It’s your channel, sell it.</p><p>Finally supply some extra details, including when to expect videos to be published and other social platforms where you are active on. If someone is reading your <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >YouTube description <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, you have already hooked them.

What Icon Should You Use for YouTube?"></a>#1. What Icon Should You Use for YouTube?</h4><p>You may choose an icon that best represents the content your channel is producing. For example, if your channel is about technology, you can have an icon of a robot or an iPhone. This way, when viewers only see your icon, they have an idea that they can expect content around tech.</p><p>Here are some websites in which you can <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >download logos and icons for YouTube videos <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</p><h4 id="2-What-Color-Should-Your-YouTube-Logo-Be"><a href="#2-What-Color-Should-Your-YouTube-Logo-Be" class="headerlink" title="#2. What Color Should Your YouTube Logo Be?"></a>#2. What Color Should Your YouTube Logo Be?</h4><p>When creating your logo, avoid trendy colors as they may go out of style. Instead, consider <a class="link"   href="https://99designs.ca/blog/tips/how-color-impacts-emotions-and-behaviors/" >the psychology of color <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</p><p>What emotions do you want your channel to evoke to your viewers?</p><p>Answering this question helps you develop a consistent branding that applies to all your content as your channel grows. Blue evokes calm and trust, whereas, red is known to increase heart rate and is associated with danger. Before you select a color scheme, know how you want your audience to feel.</p><h4 id="3-What-Font-Should-Your-YouTube-Logo-Have"><a href="#3-What-Font-Should-Your-YouTube-Logo-Have" class="headerlink" title="#3. What Font Should Your YouTube Logo Have?"></a>#3. What Font Should Your YouTube Logo Have?</h4><p>While YouTube doesn’t offer a lot of real-estate for text, you might still want to include the name of your brand on your logo.</p><p>Potentially, the font you choose for your logo will also be the font for the text that appears on your YouTube videos and your channel art. With that in mind, it is important that you pick one that works best for you at the start. Here are some details to look for when selecting a font.</p><p><strong>Legibility</strong>: Does the font get too hard to read the smaller it gets? It’s not uncommon for some fonts to become a messy blur once the size is reduced on desktop and mobile.</p><p><strong>Simplicity</strong>: The most important thing about the font is its readability. If it looks like your doctor’s handwriting, then it might not be the best choice.</p><p><strong>Consistency</strong>: Placed next to your icon, does the font look natural? You might not want to put an icon of a robot next to a font that looks like calligraphy.</p><h4 id="4-How-Should-You-Design-Your-YouTube-Logo"><a href="#4-How-Should-You-Design-Your-YouTube-Logo" class="headerlink" title="#4. How Should You Design Your YouTube Logo?"></a>#4. How Should You Design Your YouTube Logo?</h4><p>Do you really need borders or supporting texts? I ask because the more you have on your logo, the less space it will have to stand out.</p><p>White space is your friend, it keeps the viewer’s attention focused on what matters and keeps the design uncluttered.</p><p>Save your logo as a vector so that you have the ability to scale without losing the image’s quality.</p><p>I get it, you are here to make a YouTube channel, not to design a logo. You’re not a designer.

Doing so allows people to see who you are and develop an instant connection with you.</p><h4 id="5-What-Makes-A-Good-YouTube-Channel-Banner"><a href="#5-What-Makes-A-Good-YouTube-Channel-Banner" class="headerlink" title="#5. What Makes A Good YouTube Channel Banner?"></a>#5. What Makes A Good YouTube Channel Banner?</h4><p>Your YouTube banner, or sometimes known as the channel art, is the cover page for your YouTube channel.</p><p>While the old adage tells us not to judge anything by the cover, in a world where we have a surplus of content, it is something we all must do for the sake of our time. If we see channel art that doesn’t appeal to us or doesn’t match the video content created, it is jarring. We are distracted from what matters and left questioning why we are on this channel in the first place.</p><p>Alternatively, if YouTube channel art is well designed and matches the aesthetic of the channel, then it can inspire your viewers to watch more, share, and subscribe.</p><p>So with that said, what makes a great YouTube banner?</p><p><strong>Sizing</strong>: YouTube comes with <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >sizing recommendations <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. The size they suggest is because of all the different devices viewers use to consume content.</p><p>You cannot control where and how your viewers consume your content. They can be watching on desktop, smartphone, tablet, or tv via Apple TV or Chromecast. That is why it is so important to have a responsive design: appropriate sizing and layout ensures that nothing important is cut off.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/youtube-channel-art-simone-giertz.jpg"                      alt="YouTube Banners"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://bluettieu.pxf.io/c/5597632/2141680/17091" target="_top" id="2141680">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/17091-2141680" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="120" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://bluettieu.pxf.io/i/5597632/2141680/17091"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p><strong>Less is more</strong>: There is already a lot happening on your YouTube channel page. Crowding your channel art will add more chaos than clarity. Additionally, since the design will shift from device to device, you may lose elements of the design if it is overcrowded.</p><p><strong>Keep it in the middle</strong>: By keeping all the design elements and text within the safe zone, you can assure nothing will be cut out even if it is viewed on a less than optimal screen. It is a shame when you see that a headline is cut out and you cannot read the whole banner. Use YouTube’s template to help guide your design and ensure that everything important is visible.</p><p><strong>High-resolution images</strong>: Nothing shouts “I’m an amateur” like having a pixelated image for your banner. Setting a high standard for images at the start will ensure that your whole channel will look professional from the beginning.</p><p>Take a go at creating your own channel art with some <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >great YouTube design tools <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> such as Canva and Crello.</p><p>Don’t have time to design at the moment? <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Download 50 free YouTube banner <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> that we created to help busy creators like yourself get a professional page up and running right away.</p><h2 id="Part-2-Building-Out-a-YouTube-Content-Plan"><a href="#Part-2-Building-Out-a-YouTube-Content-Plan" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: Building Out a YouTube Content Plan"></a>Part 2: Building Out a YouTube Content Plan</h2><p>Now that you know how to create a YouTube channel, you will need content to fill it up.</p><p>There are many factors to having success on YouTube and one has always been delivering content consistently. You may feel at this moment, that your brain is storming with ideas, but believe me, you don’t want to get caught in a drought. The way to avoid major blockers for your channel is to have a <a class="link"   href="https://moz.com/blog/the-ultimate-guide-to-content-planning" >content plan <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> at the onset.</p><p>A content plan helps guide you towards the mission, the reason you are building this YouTube channel in the first place.</p><p><strong>Topics</strong>: Your YouTube channel will be focused on one broad topic, whether it be fashion, health, food, etc. It is hard to fly on a whim with a topic that covers such a wide scope. Creating content for these topics will require preparations and that’s why the earlier you have the content ideas for your video the more time you’ll have to research, rehearse, and get the best result.</p><p>Begin with a blank piece of paper and break down your topic into 5-10 different categories. If you have a channel about cooking, it may look something like this: breakfast, lunch, dinner, dessert, snack, etc.</p><p>From there, you can drill down more and explore specific topics such as “cheap meals,” “street food,” , etc. Niching down allows those who are looking for a more specific piece of content to find your material. Also, when one specific piece of content performs well, it will give a boost to all the other content related to that broader topic.</p><p><strong>Researching Your Ideas</strong>: Now that you have a big list of ideas, it’s time to do some research. With so many idea options, it’s easy to get overwhelmed by the work ahead, but stay focused and tackle one idea at a time.</p><p>When it comes to videos, discoverability is an important aspect of everything you create. You aren’t only competing with other YouTube channels, you are competing with everything in the world that can turn your viewer away from your channel. That is why you should make it as easy as possible for your content to be discovered.</p><p>Pro Tip: Search on YouTube and see if there is already a video for the idea you have. By taking a quick look at what content is out there, you can see who you’ll be competing with and determine if it is worth pursuing. If there are already a lot of existing videos on that topic, it might be too hard to for people find your content at first.</p><p><strong>Keyword Research</strong>: For each of your ideas, you will want to conduct extensive keyword research. This research will help dictate the tags, titles, and descriptions of your videos once they are ready to publish.</p><p>There are a few ways to conduct keyword research, but we suggest using free online tools to help cut down the time spent.</p><h3 id="1-Free-tools"><a href="#1-Free-tools" class="headerlink" title="1.

We recommend using Google Sheet and Google Calendar to start, as it is free and easy to use.</p><p>Since you are starting out, we suggest that you plan on a monthly basis, as it’ll allow you to be flexible to trending topics and adjust to insights that you’ll acquire as you analyze your content’s performance.</p><h2 id="Part-3-Producing-Your-Content"><a href="#Part-3-Producing-Your-Content" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: Producing Your Content"></a>Part 3: Producing Your Content</h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/produce-youtube-video-content-filming.jpg"                      alt="YouTube Creator Filming"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><span id="1983474">                    <video width="576" height="240" style="cursor:pointer"           poster="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1983474.png"           onclick="if(!this.playClicked){this.play();this.setAttribute('controls',true);this.playClicked=true;}">       <source src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/22993-1983474">       <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1983474.png"                      style="border: none; height: 100%; width: 100%; object-fit: contain"                >    </video>    <div style="width:360px;text-align:center"><a class="link"   href="javascript:window.open(decodeURIComponent('https%3A%2F%2Fhomestyler.sjv.io%2Fc%2F5597632%2F1983474%2F22993'), '_blank');void(0);" >Click here <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></div></span><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1983474/22993"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p>Now that you have a plan it is time to start producing your content. There are many ways to approach this, as different types of channels will have different processes for researching, capturing footage, and editing.</p><p><strong>Planning</strong>: It doesn’t have to be a fully flushed script, but any bit of planning before hitting the record button will help you prepare some valuable content to be captured. It can be an outline, breaking down the topics you want to touch on.</p><p>If it’s a food YouTube channel, you’d want the recipe and all the ingredients ready on hand. <em>Mise en place</em> is the French phrase that chefs use meaning “everything in its place” or having everything they need on hand so when dinner rush comes preparation is done and now they are ready to produce. This same mentality works when preparing to shoot a YouTube video. The more you prepare the easier the shoot and the editing will be.</p><p><strong>Equipment</strong>: At the start, you can get everything done on your smartphone. But that does depend on what your channel is going to be about and who your target audiences are. If you want to film some simple sketches to entertain people, yes, a smartphone camera can work for start. But if you are reaching a professional crowd or want to appear credible, then it might be worth it to invest in a better camera, audio, and lighting equipment.</p><p><strong>Filming&#x2F;Capturing</strong>: Always do some checks before shooting your YouTube videos as bad camera angles, poor audio quality, inadequate lighting are all easier to fix before rather than after the filming. Additionally, set a reminder to backup your footage and charge your batteries after every shoot and have an extension cord or a separate hard drive ready.</p><p><strong>Editing</strong>: Over time, you will develop your own editing style. At the start, it is best to learn the fundamentals and improve on the basics.</p><p><strong>Selecting the software</strong>: Some video editing software programs are free and others cost a lot. Do your research, sign up for free trials, and understand the limitations of the applications and the requirements you need. If money is a factor, you might want to stick with the free options such as iMovie or affordable options such as <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Filmora <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</p><p><a href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-win.jpg"                      alt="Download Filmora9 Win Version"                > </a> <a href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-mac.jpg"                      alt="Download Filmora9 Mac Version"                > </a></p><p><strong>Storytelling</strong>: Skilled editing enables YouTube creators to tell the story in the most effective way. This does not mean in chronological order. Think of what will hook the audience right away and what will be most impactful at the very end. Pro-tip: Use pre-set transitions sparingly, jump cuts are often the most effective and least distracting. Editing is an invisible art.</p><p><strong>Text, graphic or special effects</strong>: Video is a show that doesn’t tell medium, so use text sparingly. People aren’t going to your channel to read. However, text when used properly compliments the video and supplies context. Graphics and special effects are good when they support the story you are telling and cheesy when used egregiously to impress the viewer.</p><p><strong>Export to the right format</strong>: You can pretty much upload any video format to YouTube and they can figure it out. Nevertheless, YouTube recommends using MP4 and encoded with the  codec.</p><h2 id="Part-4-Optimizing-and-Distributing-Your-YouTube-Video"><a href="#Part-4-Optimizing-and-Distributing-Your-YouTube-Video" class="headerlink" title="Part 4: Optimizing and Distributing Your YouTube Video"></a>Part 4: Optimizing and Distributing Your YouTube Video</h2><p>Your job is not done after you’ve filmed, edited, and published your video on YouTube. In order to help it get discovered, you’ll need to understand what will drive your audience to click and watch your video as opposed to all the other videos on YouTube.</p><p>By performing video optimization and sharing your content in communities interested in what you are creating, you can increase the chances that your video will be seen.</p><h4 id="1-Tips-for-Writing-the-Best-Title-for-YouTube-Video"><a href="#1-Tips-for-Writing-the-Best-Title-for-YouTube-Video" class="headerlink" title="1. Tips for Writing the Best Title for YouTube Video"></a>1. Tips for Writing the Best Title for YouTube Video</h4><p>When coming up with titles for your YouTube video, you should always have your keyword research-ready on hand for reference.</p><p>YouTube keyword crawlers read from top to bottom, so it is most effective to have your keywords at the beginning of the title. Strive to build click-worthy titles that inspire curiosity, evoke an emotion, or offer a benefit.</p><p>Example:</p><p>Good: How to Deep Fry Chicken</p><p>Better: Deep Frying Chicken That’s Better Than KFC</p><p>While you have 100 characters to work with, anything beyond 70 characters will be truncated by YouTube.</p><p>Caution: Always deliver what your title is selling. Misleading viewers can cause mistrust in your content and will turn people off your channel.</p><h4 id="2-Tips-for-Writing-the-Best-Description-for-YouTube-Video"><a href="#2-Tips-for-Writing-the-Best-Description-for-YouTube-Video" class="headerlink" title="2. Tips for Writing the Best Description for YouTube Video"></a>2. Tips for Writing the Best Description for YouTube Video</h4><p>Treat the description as a short synopsis for your video with the keywords strategically placed at the beginning. Include a URL to your website or blog and have any other supporting information or links.</p><p>Also, the description is where you can include some boilerplate channel information.</p><p>You have 5,000 characters to work with, but only the first three lines will be above the fold.</p><p>Pro Tip: If your video is on the longer end (over 20 minutes) or has multiple sections, then you should consider <a class="link"   href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBiPumGnVT4" >adding timestamps <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>in the description to help the viewer skip to the spot they are most interested in.</p><h4 id="3-Tips-for-Writing-the-Best-Tags-for-YouTube-Video"><a href="#3-Tips-for-Writing-the-Best-Tags-for-YouTube-Video" class="headerlink" title="3. Tips for Writing the Best Tags for YouTube Video"></a>3. Tips for Writing the Best Tags for YouTube Video</h4><p>Keeping that keyword research handy write 5-15 tags. Start with specific keywords, then move into general keywords, and then branded keywords.</p><p>Specific keywords: how to deep fry chicken</p><p>General keywords: fried chicken recipe</p><p>Branded keywords: KFC</p><h4 id="4-Tips-for-Designing-the-Best-Thumbnail-Image"><a href="#4-Tips-for-Designing-the-Best-Thumbnail-Image" class="headerlink" title="4. Tips for Designing the Best Thumbnail Image"></a>4. Tips for Designing the Best Thumbnail Image</h4><p><strong>Customize thumbnails</strong>: It is recommended that you take some time to customize a thumbnail image for your video. This is the first impression and you want to entice the viewer to click and watch.</p><p>YouTube auto-selects your thumbnail from a random position on your timeline, so it isn’t mandatory to create a thumbnail, however, the image YouTube selects might not be what you want to use to attract your audience.</p><p><strong>Use photo editing software</strong>: To control how you want an image to look, you will need to choose a photo editing software. <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/fotophire/download/" >Wondershare PixStudio <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> is a good choice that provides various types of templates for YouTube Thumbnails, Logos, Posters, etc.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/pixstudio-online-graphic-design-maker.jpg"                      alt="pixstudio-online-graphic-design-maker"                ></p><p><strong>Have a consistent look</strong>: By having consistency, people will begin to recognize your thumbnails and even getting them excited to watch your video.</p><p><strong>Pro Tips:</strong></p><p>- Avoid using YouTube’s randomly selected thumbnail. Personalize it to stay consistent with your brand.</p><p>- Don’t clutter thumbnails. Less is more.</p><p>- Make fonts big if you are going to use text.</p><p>- Thumbnails have to have context, what is their story? Deliver on that promise.</p><p>- Using emotive faces have shown to appeal to people’s emotional cues and increases the likelihood of them clicking.</p><p>- Thumbnail file size should be 1280 x 720</p><h4 id="5-Closed-Captions-and-Uploading-a-Transcript"><a href="#5-Closed-Captions-and-Uploading-a-Transcript" class="headerlink" title="5. Closed Captions and Uploading a Transcript"></a>5. Closed Captions and Uploading a Transcript</h4><p>There are two key reasons why it is worth your time to use closed captions or upload a transcript for your YouTube videos.</p><ol><li>Having closed captions improves the video’s SEO, as Google indexes and crawls the keywords.</li><li>For those that don’t want to or can’t hear the audio will appreciate having closed caption to allow them to enjoy the content.</li></ol><h4 id="6-How-to-Share-Your-Video-with-Social-Media"><a href="#6-How-to-Share-Your-Video-with-Social-Media" class="headerlink" title="6. How to Share Your Video with Social Media"></a>6. How to Share Your Video with Social Media</h4><p>Unless you have a huge social media following, it will be challenging to get many views from those channels at the start.</p><p>Grow your social media channel gradually by targeting your ideal viewer persona and hashtagging your content. On social media channels such as Facebook and Twitter, keep producing content for them, but don’t forget to share content from other YouTubers. If you see a cool video relevant to your audience, share it as well.</p><p>Lead your followers to your YouTube channel with content designed specifically for your social media channel. For example, Instagram Stories are a great way to engage directly with your followers, giving them a sneak peek or letting them know that your latest YouTube videos are up. You can even <a class="link"   href="https://www.plannthat.com/instagram-story-links/" >link directly to your YouTube channel <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>from your Instagram story.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/instagram-story-caspar-lee.jpg"                      alt="Instagram Story Caspar Lee"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2151855/7443" target="_top" id="2151855">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2151855" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2151855/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p><em>YouTuber, Caspar Lee</em></p><p>Join groups on social networks such as Facebook, Reddit, etc. and engage in conversations that are related or complementary to your YouTube channel. The key is to find communities that are interested in the content you are producing, but approach those groups with caution and ensure that anything you share won’t be perceived as spam.</p><p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p><p>There you go, now you have made your first YouTube video. It might be something you are incredibly proud of or it might have been a great learning experience. It might have gone without a hitch or you might have encountered obstacles you weren’t anticipating. Either way, you followed through and we are happy for you.</p><p>Now, get ready for the next one.

This has gradually evolved over the years and these days the user interface of Vimeo is more attractive than YouTube. Vimeo would give the user fewer adverts, offer easy navigation and of course, allow them to watch the videos on a large video player. Though these days YouTube is also offering a ‘theatre mode’ for the full-screen view along with a skip adoption, yet the quality of its user experience is still isn’t at par with Vimeo. YouTube is still trying its best to satisfy its one billion&#x2F;month users but still, Vimeo is the winner when it comes to unparalleled user experience.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://25home.pxf.io/c/5597632/2148650/16836" target="_top" id="2148650">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/16836-2148650" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://25home.pxf.io/i/5597632/2148650/16836"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Tips-for-Editing-Videos-on-YouTube-DailyMotion-and-Vimeo"><a href="#Tips-for-Editing-Videos-on-YouTube-DailyMotion-and-Vimeo" class="headerlink" title="Tips for Editing Videos on YouTube, DailyMotion, and Vimeo"></a>Tips for Editing Videos on YouTube, DailyMotion, and Vimeo</h2><p>Before uploading your video on any one of these above-mentioned platforms the first thing you have to do is get your videos edited.

YouTube is the world’s biggest video sharing platform that already allows its users to stream live videos through third-party applications such as Wirecast Play or OBS. Less than a month ago, YouTube has finally made possible live streaming directly from a computer’s webcam. The option is currently only available on Chrome browsers, but the company claims that more browsers will start offering this feature soon.</p><p>In this article, we are going to provide you with all the information you’ll need to create seamless live streams using a webcam and introduce you to some of the best webcam models in 2021.</p><blockquote><p> Disclaimer: This post includes affiliate links</p><p> If you click on a link and make a purchase, I may receive a commission at no extra cost to you.</p></blockquote><h2 id="Best-webcams-for-YouTube-Livestreaming-in-2021"><a href="#Best-webcams-for-YouTube-Livestreaming-in-2021" class="headerlink" title="Best webcams for YouTube Livestreaming in 2021"></a>Best webcams for YouTube Livestreaming in 2021</h2><p>The quality of the video recording you intend to broadcast live is essential for the success of your live streams. Most built-in laptop webcams produce low-quality videos, and for that reason using an external webcam that captures high-resolution videos can help you create live streams that attract a lot of attention from YouTube’s community.</p><h3 id="How-to-choose-the-right-webcam-for-live-streaming-on-YouTube"><a href="#How-to-choose-the-right-webcam-for-live-streaming-on-YouTube" class="headerlink" title="How to choose the right webcam for live streaming on YouTube?"></a>How to choose the right webcam for live streaming on YouTube?</h3><p><strong>Compatability:</strong> Even the best webcams on the market are completely useless if they are not compatible with your computer. Finding a webcam that works with a PC or a Mac shouldn’t be too difficult because both Windows and iOS platforms offer support for a wide range of models.</p><p><strong>Video Resolution:</strong> YouTubers that just want to produce simple live streams don’t have to pay a lot of attention to the video resolution, because their videos don’t show too many details. Vloggers and gamers, on the other hand, should consider using webcams that produce 4K or HD footage since lower-priced options have a hard time realistically depicting colors. The quality of the video output a webcam produces can increase its price significantly, so there’s no reason investing in it if you don’t have the intention of utilizing its features to the fullest.</p><p><strong>Sound Quality:</strong> Besides the video features, you should also look into the webcam’s audio options, because no one wants to watch a video with a terrible sound. Buying an external microphone is probably the best solution to this issue, but if you can’t afford one, then purchasing a webcam with decent audio recording features is the second best option.</p><p><strong>Adjustable Location:</strong> Although the angle from which you are recording a stream may not seem important, poorly framed live streams are more likely to go unnoticed. A webcam that is easily adjustable can grant you the freedom of choosing your shots on every live stream you share online and it will enable you to control each and every detail in the video.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/logo_icon/wondershare-filmora-logo-horizontal.png"                      alt="Filmora logo"                > <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/images/common/filmora-product-banner.png"                      alt="filmora product interface"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2123736/7443" target="_top" id="2123736">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2123736" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2123736/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><!-- affiliate ads begin --><span id="1424527">                    <video width="864" height="1536" style="cursor:pointer"           poster="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1424527.png"           onclick="if(!this.playClicked){this.play();this.setAttribute('controls',true);this.playClicked=true;}">       <source src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/16446-1424527">       <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1424527.png"                      style="border: none; height: 100%; width: 100%; object-fit: contain"                >    </video>    <div style="width:540px;text-align:center"><a class="link"   href="javascript:window.open(decodeURIComponent('https%3A%2F%2Flaganoo.pxf.io%2Fc%2F5597632%2F1424527%2F16446'), '_blank');void(0);" >Click here <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></div></span><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1424527/16446"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="The-All-in-One-Screen-Recorder-Video-Editor"><a href="#The-All-in-One-Screen-Recorder-Video-Editor" class="headerlink" title="The All-in-One Screen Recorder &amp; Video Editor"></a>The All-in-One Screen Recorder &amp; Video Editor</h3><ul><li>Record desktop screen, voiceover, and webcam simultaneously</li><li>Edit recorded clips quickly with a wide range of professional tools</li><li>Built-in plentiful templates and effects</li><li>Export to MP4, MOV, MKV, GIF and multiple formats</li></ul><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Try It Free <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>For Win 7 or later (64-bit)</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Try It Free <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>For macOS 10.12 or later</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static.wondershare.com/images-filmora/images/common/securety.svg"                      alt="secure download"                >Secure Download</p><h3 id="4-Best-Webcams-for-YouTube-Live-streaming-in-2021"><a href="#4-Best-Webcams-for-YouTube-Live-streaming-in-2021" class="headerlink" title="4 Best Webcams for YouTube Live streaming in 2021"></a>4 Best Webcams for YouTube Live streaming in 2021</h3><p>There are thousands of different webcams you can use to record a live stream, but the models featured below are some of the very best currently available on the market.</p><h4 id="1-Logitech-4K-Pro-webcam"><a href="#1-Logitech-4K-Pro-webcam" class="headerlink" title="1.

lens</strong>. Wide-angle lenses fit much more of a scene into your camera frame, making it ideal for capturing establishing shots. You’ll also need a wide-angle lens if you plan on holding your camera out in front of yourself with an extended arm to get selfie footage.</p><p>As a travel vlogger, you’ll also want to show some close-up shots of the various subjects in your scene. If you don’t mind walking up to these subjects, the lens I recommend for this is a <strong>standard lens</strong>.</p><p>If, however, you want to be able to shoot these close-up shots from a farther distance, you’ll need a <strong>telephoto lens</strong>.</p><p>But you probably don’t want to carry and switch so many lenses as you travel, right? A convenient solution is to get a zoom lens that covers a wide range of focal lengths. For example, travel vlogger Sam Kolder shoots with a Canon EF 24-105mm f&#x2F;4 lens – that’s a wide-angle lens, standard lens, and telephoto lens all in one lens!</p><p>If most of your travel video shooting will be done handheld, you should also definitely look for a lens equipped with <strong>optical image stabilization</strong>.</p><p>Check out my <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Best Camera Lens for YouTube <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> to gain a more in-depth understanding of lenses and how they work.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><span id="1993647">                    <video width="128" height="480" style="cursor:pointer"           poster="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1993647.png"           onclick="if(!this.playClicked){this.play();this.setAttribute('controls',true);this.playClicked=true;}">       <source src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/22993-1993647">       <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1993647.png"                      style="border: none; height: 100%; width: 100%; object-fit: contain"                >    </video>    <div style="width:80px;text-align:center"><a class="link"   href="javascript:window.open(decodeURIComponent('https%3A%2F%2Fhomestyler.sjv.io%2Fc%2F5597632%2F1993647%2F22993'), '_blank');void(0);" >Click here <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></div></span><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1993647/22993"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="1-2-Travel-Vlogging-Accessories"><a href="#1-2-Travel-Vlogging-Accessories" class="headerlink" title="1.2 Travel Vlogging Accessories"></a>1.2 Travel Vlogging Accessories</h3><p><strong>Camera Accessories That Are Good For Travel Vlogging</strong></p><table><thead><tr><th><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/tripod1.jpg"                      alt="Travel Tripod"                ></th><th><strong>1.

Travel Vlog</strong></p><p>Travel vlogging, the kind where you film yourself just going about your day in a different part of the world, is a great way to not only document your travel moments and memories for yourself, but also a great way to share your experience with others.</p><p>Rather than being too picky with your video shots and possibly ending up with a lack of footage to work with, shoot as much as you can.</p><p>Try to capture your thoughts and feelings around the things you taste, smell, see and hear. Sharing these details can help your viewers feel more like they’re with you on your travels.</p><p> <strong>2. Tips or Tricks for Traveling</strong></p><p>Although learning from mistakes during your travels can be a rewarding experience, most people want to avoid them and, rather, enjoy their trip as much as they possibly can. After all, travel, for most people, happens in intervals that seem too short. You can help this sizable group by offering travel tips and tricks.</p><p>Prepare a list of tips and tricks, a shot list of all the footage you’ll need to go along with those tips, and then capture all your footage. As you go through your list, you can then cut away to your associated travel shots.</p><p> <strong>3. Video Tour of a Location</strong></p><p>Many people are curious about different parts of the world and would love to join a tour without the high cost of flights, hotels, meals, and admission tickets. Give them that experience by making a video tour.</p><p> <strong>4. Review An Attraction or Experience</strong></p><p>A lot of travelers having a limited amount of time and money to enjoy their chosen travel destinations want to know which attractions and experiences to prioritize and which ones to skip. Help them make their decision by making a video review.</p><p> <strong>5. Timelapse Videos</strong></p><p>All you need in addition to your camera is a tripod to get started with making timelapse videos. Your tripod stabilizes your shot as your camera captures all the changes that take place in a given location.</p><p>When your footage is sped up, your viewers can appreciate all the changes that take place that they may not have had the patience to sit through in real-time. It’s also interesting to observe the passage of time in a different way.</p><p> <strong>6. Average Daily Cost</strong></p><p>Before going on a trip, many people try to make a budget and figure out how much money to exchange into foreign currency. Making a good budget and getting just enough foreign cash, though, requires you to know how much, on average, things cost.</p><p>Make a helpful video on the average cost of daily expenses including meals and transportation like Paolo did in the above video “Average Daily Cost in Tokyo Japan | Is it Expensive?.” His video actually helped me a lot when I was trying to come up with a budget for my recent trip to Japan.</p><p> <strong>7. Interview Locals</strong></p><p>People don’t travel only to see popular attractions. A lot of people travel to connect with and understand people from different parts of the world.</p><p>Interviewing locals and sharing their thoughts can help to provide that kind of connection.</p><p> <strong>8. What’s in My Backpack?</strong></p><p>Packing for a trip can say a lot about who you are as a person because it involves prioritizing items based on your personal values.</p><p>For your next trip, share a little part of yourself with your audience through a video about the things you’ve packed in your bag.</p><p> <strong>9. Talk About Your Own Home City</strong></p><p>When you’ve lived in your own home city for so long, you might forget that people all over the world may marvel at the things you take for granted because all those things just happen to be at your doorstep.</p><p>Take advantage of the expert that you already are in your own home city and make an informative video for others who are taking a trip there.</p><p> <strong>10. How To Become a Travel Vlogger</strong></p><p>After you’ve done a lot of travel vlogging and learned so much along the way, you can make a video about how to be a travel vlogger.</p><p>In the above video, Andrew Santos teaches how to make a travel video, all while hilariously poking fun at many of the cliché trends in the travel genre.</p><h2 id="PART-3-TRAVEL-VIDEO-EDITING"><a href="#PART-3-TRAVEL-VIDEO-EDITING" class="headerlink" title="PART 3: TRAVEL VIDEO EDITING"></a>PART 3: TRAVEL VIDEO EDITING</h2><h4 id="Video-Editing-Software"><a href="#Video-Editing-Software" class="headerlink" title="Video Editing Software"></a>Video Editing Software</h4><p>When it comes to editing your travel video together, there are different kinds of software you can do that with.</p><table><thead><tr><th><strong>FREE VIDEO EDITING SOFTWARE</strong></th><th><strong>PAID VIDEO EDITING SOFTWARE</strong></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><a class="link"   href="https://www.openshot.org/" >OpenShot Video Editor <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> (Windows, Mac, Linux) <a class="link"   href="https://shotcut.org/" >ShotCut <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> (Windows, Mac, Linux) <a class="link"   href="https://hitfilm.com/express" >Hitfilm Express <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> (Windows, Mac) <a class="link"   href="http://www.nchsoftware.com/videopad/index.html" >VideoPad Video Editor <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> (Windows) <a class="link"   href="https://www.lwks.com/" >Lightworks <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> (Windows, Mac, Linux) <a class="link"   href="http://www.videosoftdev.com/" >VSDC Video Editor <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> (Windows) <a class="link"   href="http://www.machetesoft.com/home/about-machete-video-editor-lite.html" >Machete Video Editor Lite <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> (Windows) <a class="link"   href="http://avidemux.sourceforge.net/" >Avidemux <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> (Windows, Mac, Linux, BSD) Read more about each software in our post about <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >The Best Free Video Editing Software for YouTube – Top 8 Reviews <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</td><td><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Wondershare Filmora X <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> (Windows, Mac) - start at $49.99 for one year license and Free trial <a class="link"   href="https://www.apple.com/ca/final-cut-pro/" >Final Cut Pro <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> (Mac) - $299.99, Free trial <a class="link"   href="https://www.vegascreativesoftware.com/ca/vegas-movie-studio/" >Vegas Movie Studio <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> (Windows) - $49.99</td></tr></tbody></table><h4 id="Travel-Themed-Video-Effects"><a href="#Travel-Themed-Video-Effects" class="headerlink" title="Travel-Themed Video Effects"></a>Travel-Themed Video Effects</h4><p>If you use Filmora Video Editor, you can also take advantage of a variety of travel-themed video effects packs, like the one shown in the above video, filled with titles, transitions, filters, overlays, and other visual elements.</p><p>For my recent trip to Japan, I actually used Filmora Effects’ Japanese set.</p><p>At the 2:10 mark of the above video, I used an overlay of falling cherry blossom leaves.

Otherwise, keep your SLR camera concealed.</li><li>Never leave your equipment unattended in a visible area, not even in a locked car.</li></ul><p> <strong>Pre-Production and Planning</strong></p><ul><li>Before shooting, make a shot list of all the footage you need.</li><li>Have all your filming equipment that needs to be calibrated all calibrated and ready to use.</li></ul><p> <strong>Onscreen Performance</strong></p><ul><li>Look into your lens, not the projected image of yourself on your camera’s flip screen.</li><li>Show a lot of energy as you film yourself.</li><li>If you’re nervous about talking to the camera in public, keep your talking head clips short and gradually build your way up to longer clips. You can break up longer sentences by saying a few words from one scene, saying a few more in another, and finishing off your last words, again, in another scene. Later, in editing, you can stitch all of those clips together to make one fluid sentence.</li><li>If you’re nervous about talking to the camera in public, you can capture your talking headshots later when you find a more secluded space.</li></ul><p> <strong>Audio Recording</strong></p><ul><li>Silence everything you don’t want your mic to record.</li><li>Put your mobile phone in airplane mode.</li><li>Block wind from reaching your mic with windscreens and dead cats.</li><li>Upgrade your mic.</li><li>Adjust your levels.</li><li>Get close to the sound you are wanting to record.</li></ul><p>Check out <a class="link"   href="https://www.filmora.io/community-blog/10-recording-tips-to-get-the-best-sound-from-your-390.html" >10 Recording Tips to Get The Best Sound From Your Microphone <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> for more audio recording tips.</p><p> <strong>Filming</strong></p><ul><li>To avoid crowds, wake up early and grab your footage early while everyone else is still sleeping or getting ready.</li><li>Capture wide shots, medium shots, and close-up shots for better coverage.</li><li>Use the Sun Seeker app to set up your sunrise&#x2F;sunset shots better.</li><li>If your camera can record 4K footage, record in 4K all the scenes that you want to zoom in closer later in editing without losing quality (your video project in editing has to be at 1920p x 1080p for this to work).</li></ul><p> <strong>Stabilization</strong></p><ul><li>If you’re trying to get shots with movement by walking, rather than walking as you normally would walk with your knees bent for steadier shots.</li><li>If you’re shooting something in front of your handheld, lean your arm against your own body for steadier shots.</li><li>Use a stabilizing gimbal with your camera.</li></ul><p> <strong>Timelapse&#x2F;Hyperlapse</strong></p><ul><li>Select scenes where you can see a lot of change over time (not a still building in front of a cloudless smoggy sky).</li><li>Set longer intervals for scenes that change very slowly over time.</li><li>Pre-set your focus. Turn autofocus off.</li><li>Shoot time-lapses&#x2F;hyper-lapses in manual mode to prevent the flickering that occurs with changing light conditions in automatic settings.</li><li>If your camera is set on a tripod in a fixed position, turn your optical image stabilization off.</li><li>If you aren’t holding onto your camera as it’s in the middle of making a timelapse video, at least keep your camera and tripod attached by some kind of leash mechanism.</li><li>For moving time-lapses or hyper-lapses, try to keep one point of reference in the same position within your camera frame.</li></ul><p> <strong>Slow Motion</strong></p><ul><li>Shoot slow-motion videos when there is plenty of light.</li><li>For actions that are as slow as walking, slowing down your footage to 50% of the original speed looks good enough. If your video editing project is in 30 fps, shooting your video in 60 fps will give you a 50% slow-motion video. If your video editing project is in 60 fps, shooting your video in 120 fps will give you a 50% slow-motion video. Any slower is overkill for slowing down the speed of walking.</li><li>For actions that are as fast as water splashing, slowing down your footage as little as 15% of the original speed can look good. For a video editing project in 30 fps, you would need a camera that can shoot at up to 240 fps to slow your footage down this much.</li></ul><p> <strong>Storage and Back-Up</strong></p><ul><li>If you’re using a phone that can store images and videos on a separate SD card, take advantage of that and record your travel footage onto your SD card. Later, you can easily get to your travel media as it will all be in one place.</li><li>If you have your laptop on you, regularly transfer your media files from your cameras to your external hard drives.</li><li>If you don’t want to bring your laptop on your trip and plan to video edit once you’re back home, use a USB memory card reader that connects with an app on your phone to transfer your files into your external hard drive.</li><li>If you have access to a reliable internet connection and you leave your laptop at your place of accommodation, have your computer upload your files onto cloud storage while you are out to travel vlogging.</li><li>Take advantage of Google Photos’ free, unlimited cloud storage for video files up to 1080p.</li></ul><p> <strong>Video Editing</strong></p><ul><li>If you’re editing a video project with videos from multiple different cameras, make sure to set the correct time and date on all of them before you start filming. Later, in editing, you can import all your image and video files and sort them in the exact order that they were taken.</li><li>If your video editing software can work with proxies, transcode all your video files into proxy files for much faster editing.</li></ul><p> <strong>Posting On YouTube</strong></p><ul><li>Choose a title that people will search for. Keep your target keywords at the beginning of your title. “S01E01: My Summer Backpacking Trip” is not an effective title. Instead, a title like “Going Up The Eiffel Tower… Beautiful View of Paris!” would be better.</li></ul><!-- affiliate ads begin --><span id="1374820">                    <video width="200" height="200" style="cursor:pointer"           poster="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1374820.png"           onclick="if(!this.playClicked){this.play();this.setAttribute('controls',true);this.playClicked=true;}">       <source src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/15852-1374820">       <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1374820.png"                      style="border: none; height: 100%; width: 100%; object-fit: contain"                >    </video>    <div style="width:125px;text-align:center"><a class="link"   href="javascript:window.open(decodeURIComponent('https%3A%2F%2Fthefitville.pxf.io%2Fc%2F5597632%2F1374820%2F15852'), '_blank');void(0);" >Click here <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></div></span><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1374820/15852"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Ready-to-Become-a-Travel-Vlogger"><a href="#Ready-to-Become-a-Travel-Vlogger" class="headerlink" title="Ready to Become a Travel Vlogger?"></a>Ready to Become a Travel Vlogger?</h2><p>Here in this article, I shared travel vlogging cameras &amp;accessories, travel video ideas&amp; resources, and travel vlogging tips.

While the entire world is anxiously about the 2018 FIFA World Cup, the football videos on YouTube are booming. In fact, the football-related searches on this platform have been soaring in the months leading up to the 2018 FIFA World Cup, despite the fact that some of the most popular football clubs in the world are still ignoring how powerful YouTube has become.</p><p>We have produced the infographic below which clearly shows how popular football videos are on YouTube, so let’s have a look at some of the mind-blowing facts we’ve discovered.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://filmora.wondershare.com/youtube-video-editing/top-insights-into-football-videos-on-youtube.png"                      alt="top insights into football videos on youtube"                ></p><blockquote><p> Disclaimer: This post includes affiliate links</p><p> If you click on a link and make a purchase, I may receive a commission at no extra cost to you.</p></blockquote><h2 id="Football-Content-Has-Never-Been-More-Popular-on-YouTube"><a href="#Football-Content-Has-Never-Been-More-Popular-on-YouTube" class="headerlink" title="Football Content Has Never Been More Popular on YouTube"></a>Football Content Has Never Been More Popular on YouTube</h2><p>The football gods, like Cristiano Ronaldo, Lionel Messi or Neymar Jr are making enormous amounts of money, in addition to having an iconic status in the mass media. Such state of affairs explains why YouTube videos with these superstars saw an 80% increase in watch time over the course of the last year.</p><p>Interestingly, the highest amount of football-related searches on the world’s largest video sharing platform are coming from the South American and European countries. For example, France’s young star Kylian Mbappé is a popular search in his home country, while videos of Messi, Ronaldo or Neymar are popular searches around the globe.</p><p>The number of YouTube users who are watching the game highlights has doubled over the course of the last two years, while the number of match recap viewers has increased 9 times since the last World Cup in 2014. The live streaming content related to football is also gaining momentum, although it still isn’t nearly as popular as the Trick Shot videos or Drills and Skills videos that saw a 6x increase in watch time in the last four years.</p><p>Furthermore, some of the most viewed videos on YouTube are football related, since Shakira’s Waka Waka, the official 2010 World Cup song currently has 1.9 billion views. These statistics show how big the football audience on YouTube really is, and that brands and independent entrepreneurs have much to gain by including football related content on their YouTube channels.</p><p>Music videos related to previous World Cups have attracted 12% of women more than the videos that show footage of the Euro Cup, which clearly demonstrates that large audiences can be reached if the video doesn’t include the actual gameplay.</p><p>As a matter of fact, football audiences are also largely attracted to gaming content, entertainment, and music videos since as much as 18% of the football audience frequently watches entertainment videos.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2087485/7443" target="_top" id="2087485">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2087485" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2087485/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Are-Sports-the-Next-Big-Thing-On-YouTube"><a href="#Are-Sports-the-Next-Big-Thing-On-YouTube" class="headerlink" title="Are Sports the Next Big Thing On YouTube?"></a>Are Sports the Next Big Thing On YouTube?</h2><p>At the moment, sports videos are growing faster than any other genre of videos you can find on YouTube, including entertainment or music, while the branded partnerships in this niche are growing 111% faster than all of the sports videos combined. The window of opportunity is clear for all brands that support sports activities.</p><p>Furthermore, brand ads for corporate giants such as Nike, Gatorade or Addidas attracted millions of views, which means that the leading brands in the world of sports have recognized YouTube as a marketplace they can no longer ignore. Brands that want to gain more recognition on the international market can seize this opportunity to team up with influencers on YouTube to present and broaden the reach of their products.</p><p>Besides soccer that is currently dominating the largest video sharing platform in the world, basketball, extreme sports and winter sports also provide access to huge audiences and show promising signs that they can help brands and influencers generate more revenue. Popular YouTubers should try to include more sports-related videos on their channels because it might help them attract new followers and secure a foothold in a rapidly growing market.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/richard-bennett.jpg"                      alt="author avatar"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2068425/7443" target="_top" id="2068425">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2068425" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2068425/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p>Richard Bennett</p><p>Richard Bennett is a writer and a lover of all things video.</p><p>Follow @Richard Bennett</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://youtube-zero.techidaily.com/024-approved-transform-your-games-into-a-live-stream-spectacle/"><u>[New] 2024 Approved Transform Your Games Into a Live Stream Spectacle</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-tips.techidaily.com/chieve-youtube-profitability-the-milestone-of-500plus-subscribers-unlocked-for-2024/"><u>[New] Achieve Youtube Profitability The Milestone of 500+ Subscribers Unlocked for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook-videos.techidaily.com/new-elevating-roi-with-strategic-facebook-animation-ads-for-2024/"><u>[New] Elevating ROI with Strategic Facebook Animation Ads for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://some-knowledge.techidaily.com/new-iconic-discussions-in-history-top-10-on-reddit/"><u>[New] Iconic Discussions in History -

We recommend you build your following organically, but we’ve provided this information if you feel the risk is worth it.</p><p>To gain organic traffic for your YouTube videos, you need good <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >YouTube video editing software <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> that helps you to express your ideas and grow up the YouTube channel.

It’s hard to crack the top search engine rankings as a small channel. Many people on YouTube would probably love their content, but all of those views are going to already popular channels.</p><p>Many YouTubers look for alternative ways to get views for their videos, not to replace organic views, but to better position their videos to be seen by real viewers. Buying views or signing up for a view exchange platform are two methods some YouTubers consider, and another is bots.</p><p><strong>View exchange platforms are allowed, and buying views is grey, but bots are against the rules. Warning:</strong> be aware that increasing your view count with a bot is against YouTube’s Terms of Service and that if you get caught, your video will be taken down.

Bots automatically add views to your videos.</p><p>Setting up a bot can be as easy as using other pieces of software, and there are lots of free tutorials on YouTube for view bots.</p><h2 id="Why-Use-a-YouTube-View-Bot"><a href="#Why-Use-a-YouTube-View-Bot" class="headerlink" title="Why Use a YouTube View Bot?"></a>Why Use a YouTube View Bot?</h2><p>Bots are used to create the illusion that a video is already popular to attract real viewers who view the existing view count as ‘social proof’ of the video’s quality. The main benefit is that it is fast, easy, and usually free. There are other ways, besides bots, bot accomplishes this, but if a YouTuber is resorting to a bot, it probably means they don’t have the money to buy real human views or the time to participate in a view exchange platform.</p><p>Bots can also be used to generate comments and likes for videos.</p><h2 id="What-Else-Can-A-YouTube-View-Bot-Do"><a href="#What-Else-Can-A-YouTube-View-Bot-Do" class="headerlink" title="What Else Can A YouTube View Bot Do?"></a>What Else Can A YouTube View Bot Do?</h2><p>The most effective bots come with more features than bypassing Captchas and generating views.</p><p>You can set up a YouTube bot to perform daily tasks and automate your workflow. An example might be ensuring that every video on your page gets a view and comment every day. You can also use bots (or content organization platforms) to share your videos across social media automatically. This frees you up to focus on creating quality content.</p><p>Using a bot to increase your views artificially has its dangers, but it also has the potential to kick start the organic growth of your channel. Once you start attracting real viewers and subscribers, you will not need to keep relying on a bot.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2144272/7443" target="_top" id="2144272">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2144272" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2144272/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Are-There-Risks-to-Using-A-YouTube-View-Bot"><a href="#Are-There-Risks-to-Using-A-YouTube-View-Bot" class="headerlink" title="Are There Risks to Using A YouTube View Bot?"></a>Are There Risks to Using A YouTube View Bot?</h2><p> <strong>Yes.</strong></p><p>Bots are against YouTube’s TOS, especially for partners using AdSense (<a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >learn more about YouTube’s partnership program here <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>). Suppose you are suspected of using a bot. In that case, your videos can get taken down, and you could lose the ability to monetize content (YouTube reviews channels now before they can monetize, and it will be obvious to them if you’ve used a bot to get to the 10,000 lifetime views you need for monetization). Repeated offenses could even get you banned from YouTube, and it is much easier to lose AdSense access.</p><p>The biggest danger isn’t YouTube taking your videos down, though. So long as you don’t persist after being warned, you can always recover. No, the real danger of bots is that they generate low retention views. Essentially, the views you get from a bot appear to YouTube’s algorithm as if people have clicked on your videos but haven’t watched them. The algorithm interprets that as ‘the people clicking on this don’t like it, we should rank it lower down in search results. Rather than attracting organic views, bots can make it very difficult for a real viewer to find your content.</p><p>If you are going to use a bot, you need to use it smartly and sparingly to prevent damage to your channel.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2112007/7443" target="_top" id="2112007">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2112007" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2112007/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Alternatives-to-Using-View-Bots-to-Increase-YouTube-Views"><a href="#Alternatives-to-Using-View-Bots-to-Increase-YouTube-Views" class="headerlink" title="Alternatives to Using View Bots to Increase YouTube Views"></a>Alternatives to Using View Bots to Increase YouTube Views</h2><h3 id="1-Organically-Growing-Your-Channel"><a href="#1-Organically-Growing-Your-Channel" class="headerlink" title="1.

This is because the platform allows content creators to categorize their videos into public, private, or unlisted based on their preferences.</p><p>To help you uncover the content that you otherwise wouldn’t have access to, we’ve compiled a detailed guide to show you how to find YouTube hidden videos. We’ve also explained why so many unlisted videos are now labeled as private.</p><p>So, let’s get started with our guide without any further delay!</p><blockquote><p> Disclaimer: This post includes affiliate links</p><p> If you click on a link and make a purchase, I may receive a commission at no extra cost to you.</p></blockquote><h2 id="4-Types-of-Videos-on-YouTube"><a href="#4-Types-of-Videos-on-YouTube" class="headerlink" title="4 Types of Videos on YouTube"></a>4 Types of Videos on YouTube</h2><p>Firstly, let’s learn about the background of the types of YouTube videos. YouTube videos fall into the following four broad categories:</p><p><strong>Public Videos:</strong> YouTube contains videos on many themes and topics. It makes it impossible to watch all uploaded content under a specific category.</p><p>So, whenever you search for a video or theme, a list of content is displayed in the search result: “<strong>Public</strong> <strong>Videos</strong>.” It means that they are visible to everyone around the globe (depending on the terms and conditions). Moreover, you can share, like, unlike, download, or add these videos to your playlists for later watching.</p><p><strong>Private Videos</strong>: Private videos on YouTube can only be seen by people invited by the person who uploaded the video. This means that only those with access to the video’s shareable link can watch it.</p><p>Private videos are not visible to the public or to people who are not logged into YouTube. Hence, it is a great way to share sensitive or personal information with a select group.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/private-video-on-youtube.png"                      alt="private video on youtube"                ></p><p><strong>Unlisted Video</strong> Unlisted videos on YouTube are not publicly visible on the site. They can only be seen by people who have the URL. This category works as a bridge between private and public videos. It is accessible only through sharable links without appealing in any YouTube public playlist or search result.</p><p>You might upload an unlisted video to YouTube if you do not want everyone to see it. However, you still want to share it with specific people, like your friends or family. You might also use an unlisted video to test out a new idea before making it public on the video-sharing platform.</p><p><strong>Age-Restricted Videos</strong>: Age-restricted videos on YouTube are not suitable for all audiences. It may contain content that includes violence, profanity, sexual content, and other inappropriate material. YouTube requires that users be at least 18 years old to view these types of videos.</p><p>If you search on YouTube and come across an age-restricted video, you will be asked to confirm your age before viewing its content.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/age-restricted-videos-on-youtube.png"                      alt="age restricted video on youtube"                ></p><h2 id="How-To-Find-Unlisted-YouTube-Videos"><a href="#How-To-Find-Unlisted-YouTube-Videos" class="headerlink" title="How To Find Unlisted YouTube Videos"></a>How To Find Unlisted YouTube Videos</h2><p>Now that we’ve learned about the four types of YouTube content, let’s discuss how you can find unlisted YouTube videos:</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/2135357/19272" target="_top" id="2135357">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-2135357" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="320" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/2135357/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="How-To-Find-Other-People’s-Unlisted-YouTube-Videos"><a href="#How-To-Find-Other-People’s-Unlisted-YouTube-Videos" class="headerlink" title="How To Find Other People’s Unlisted YouTube Videos?"></a>How To Find Other People’s Unlisted YouTube Videos?</h3><p>Since <strong>unavailable videos in YouTube playlists are hidden</strong> from general public viewers, you cannot find them on YouTube or Google search results.</p><p>However, the following workaround can help you watch these YouTube videos without facing much trouble:</p><p><strong>Step 1:</strong> First, open a browser on your PC and visit the <a class="link"   href="https://unlistedvideos.com/" >Unlisted Videos <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> website.

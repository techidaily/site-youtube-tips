Your outro, or end screen, on YouTube is your last chance to keep viewers on your channel. This can help you increase your channel’s watch time and get your videos ranked higher in search results.</p><p>Here are 6 outro maker sites where you can get outros and end cards.

Outro Maker"></a>1. <a class="link"   href="https://outromaker.com/blog/free-outro-templates-for-download" >Outro Maker <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h4><p><strong>Overview:</strong> <em>Outro Maker provides interactive, animated, end screens for YouTube videos at a low monthly cost.</em></p><p>On Outro Maker’s home page there’s a testimonials section featuring well-known YouTubers like Kandee Johnson. They’ve definitely got the social proof to back up their claims about ease and quality.</p><p>Outro Maker is a paid service ($3 per month for the basic package) and the biggest issue facing it is that a lot of the features it charges for have become free features of YouTube’s own end screen tool. You get access to templates and a template maker with Outro Maker, though, and that may be the important thing for you.</p><h4 id="2-Biteable"><a href="#2-Biteable" class="headerlink" title="2. Biteable"></a>2. <a class="link"   href="https://biteable.com/" >Biteable <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h4><p><strong>Overview:</strong> <em>Biteable skews more towards intros than outros, but makes up for it by being free.</em></p><p>Biteable has free video templates for YouTube intros and outros. You can use one of their pre-built options, or you can customize one of their video styles with your own logo, colors, and music.</p><p>This site definitely skews more towards intros than outros and they don’t really provide end screen cards. It would be up to you to choose a video style and customize it to make it work for your purpose, which shouldn’t be too much of a burden since the site is free.</p><h4 id="3-Tube-Arsenal"><a href="#3-Tube-Arsenal" class="headerlink" title="3. Tube Arsenal"></a>3. <a class="link"   href="https://tubearsenal.com/" >Tube Arsenal <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h4><p><strong>Overview:</strong> <em>Tube Arsenal allows you to customize your intro on the site and download it for about $10.</em></p><p>Tube Arsenal has animated outro templates&#x2F;end screen cards as well as an on-site clip editor you can use to customize them with your channel’s colors&#x2F;logo&#x2F;images. They have template cards with slots for videos&#x2F;playlists as well as logos and subscribe buttons.</p><p>Tube Arsenal’s outros tend to cost $9 for 720p and $11 for 1080p. Some of their options include stylized ‘reveals’ of the ‘next video’ slots (i.e. they appear bit-by-bit from left to right) which will not be smoothly compatible with YouTube’s end screen tool (where the video previews will simply pop up).</p><h4 id="4-Renderforest"><a href="#4-Renderforest" class="headerlink" title="4. Renderforest"></a>4. <a class="link"   href="https://www.renderforest.com/" >Renderforest <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h4><p><strong>Overview:</strong> <em>Render Forest lets you download intros with 3D text for $20, and you can also use them as outros.</em></p><p>Render Forest is an intro maker that can also work as an outro maker (their templates aren’t set up like end screens). They have a lot of 3D options, which is something only a few other outro makers can offer, and they have been used by a lot of major brands.</p><p>One drawback of Renderforest is that it is significantly more expensive than other services on this list. It will cost you $20 for a 720p clip.</p><h4 id="5-Panzoid"><a href="#5-Panzoid" class="headerlink" title="5. Panzoid"></a>5. <a class="link"   href="https://panzoid.com/" >Panzoid <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h4><p><strong>Overview:</strong> <em>Panzoid is a completely free service where you can get high-quality outros with 3D text.</em></p><p>Panzoid is a community-driven site where creators make templates for intros and outros and post them for other creators to customize and download for free. There are a lot of high-quality clips on Panzoid, and most of what you find is 3D (a major perk).</p><h4 id="6-Intro-Cave"><a href="#6-Intro-Cave" class="headerlink" title="6. Intro Cave"></a>6. <a class="link"   href="https://introcave.com/" >Intro Cave <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h4><p><strong>Overview:</strong> <em>It costs $5 for a customized clip at Intro Cave.</em></p><p>As the name suggests, Intro Cave has a focus on intro videos. However, you can still use their customization system as an outro maker.</p><p>Although things do go on sale, they tend to charge $5 for a 720p clip.</p><h2 id="YouTube-Outro-Maker-Alternative-Wondershare-Filmora"><a href="#YouTube-Outro-Maker-Alternative-Wondershare-Filmora" class="headerlink" title="YouTube Outro Maker Alternative-Wondershare Filmora"></a>YouTube Outro Maker Alternative-<a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Wondershare Filmora <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h2><p>Wondershare Filmora is a great video editor for all creators.

It brings to your screen tones of perks for better viewing. However, the service isn’t still widely known, and most people are on the verge of understanding what is entailed in the subscription. Most YouTube premium subscribers attest that the service is of value and are even relieved of the constant ads in the Free version. Dive into the article for more insights.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/youtube-premium-subscription-1.png"                      alt="youtube premium subscriber"                ></p><h4 id="In-this-article"><a href="#In-this-article" class="headerlink" title="In this article"></a>In this article</h4><p>01 <a href="#part1">What is YouTube Premium?</a></p><p>02 <a href="#part2">Is YouTube Premium worth subscribing to?</a></p><blockquote><p> Disclaimer: This post includes affiliate links</p><p> If you click on a link and make a purchase, I may receive a commission at no extra cost to you.</p></blockquote><h2 id="What-is-YouTube-Premium"><a href="#What-is-YouTube-Premium" class="headerlink" title="What is YouTube Premium?"></a>What is YouTube Premium?</h2><p>This streaming service was initially launched in 2014 and was later rebranded in 2018 as YouTube Premium. It includes YouTube music and other features that Google added to it. You can download content, perform background playback and even get access to YouTube original content. Note that this came at a cost as its price was raised. But what remains is that you get value for your money.</p><h4 id="1-What-service-is-included-in-the-Premium-subscription"><a href="#1-What-service-is-included-in-the-Premium-subscription" class="headerlink" title="1. What service is included in the Premium subscription?"></a>1. What service is included in the Premium subscription?</h4><p>The Premium subscription is an after-sought service that includes these services.</p><p>Background play: It allows one to play your videos in the background, enabling you to use the app as a music player.</p><p>Offline playback: Easily view your videos on your phone or tablet. It means you can download a video or music and play them while not on the internet.</p><p>Ad-free videos: Say goodbye to popular ads with YouTube Free subscription. You already catered for your freedom in the subscription.</p><p>YouTube Music Premium: YouTube music is available for free even though you won’t download it for offline playback on this tier.</p><p>Flip between apps swiftly: Your videos will continue playing even if you switch to another app. You can flip apps on your device, like check emails, read Twitter, scroll to texts and still play your videos.</p><h4 id="2-The-price-of-a-YouTube-Premium-subscription"><a href="#2-The-price-of-a-YouTube-Premium-subscription" class="headerlink" title="2. The price of a YouTube Premium subscription"></a>2. The price of a YouTube Premium subscription</h4><p>YouTube Premium isn’t different from other services. Like most streaming services, you get family and student plans. YouTube Premium costs your $6.99 monthly subscription for students’ plans. You, however, need to verify that you are a student. A family plan comes at $17.99 per month, where you can add up to five members. Single YouTube Premium will cost you $11.99 a month</p><h4 id="3-Does-YouTube-Premium-provide-an-annual-plan"><a href="#3-Does-YouTube-Premium-provide-an-annual-plan" class="headerlink" title="3. Does YouTube Premium provide an annual plan?"></a>3. Does YouTube Premium provide an annual plan?</h4><p>No. YouTube Premium does not provide an annual plan. You can only pay your subscription per month.</p><h4 id="4-What-is-the-difference-between-YouTube-TV-and-YouTube-Premium"><a href="#4-What-is-the-difference-between-YouTube-TV-and-YouTube-Premium" class="headerlink" title="4. What is the difference between YouTube TV and YouTube Premium"></a>4. What is the difference between YouTube TV and YouTube Premium</h4><p>Even though they sound similar, YouTube TV and YouTube Premium are different in many aspects. While YouTube Premium is a paid subscription, YouTube TV is a live streaming service. Let’s explore more differences.</p><h5 id="What-is-included"><a href="#What-is-included" class="headerlink" title="What is included"></a>What is included</h5><p>If you subscribe to YouTube Premium, then you unlock other streaming features. These include watching YouTube without ads on its apps, managing offline viewing, playing your videos in the background, and getting YouTube Music, among others.</p><p>You can watch various channels over the internet with YouTube TV, live. It offers you close to 90 channels cutting across lifestyle, news, entertainment, sports, etc. Likewise, you can stream live broadcasts from top networks like NBC, FOX, ABC, etc. It will also splash your screen with news channels from BBC America, CNN, FOX News, etc.</p><h5 id="Cost"><a href="#Cost" class="headerlink" title="Cost"></a>Cost</h5><p>When it comes to pricing, YouTube Premium costs $11.00 per month with a free, one-month trial for new subscribers. It also has different plans for students and families. On the other hand, YouTube TV starts at $64.99 per month. However, first-time subscribers can get a free offer of up to one week at no cost. This rate may seem high, but it is competitive with other live TV streaming services.</p><h5 id="Accessibility"><a href="#Accessibility" class="headerlink" title="Accessibility"></a>Accessibility</h5><p>YouTube TV is readily available on the web, mobile platforms, and media streaming devices like Fire TV and Chromecast. You can also download the YouTube TV app to enjoy it on players like game consoles and PlayStations. For YouTube Premium, you’ll easily access it by subscription.</p><p>However, there are areas where both YouTube TV and YouTube Premium overlap. Both will let you watch YouTube Originals.</p><p>You will also enjoy your videos without adverts interruption. Additionally, it would be best to have an internet connection to stream your videos before downloading. And after downloading and saving your files, you can stream them offline on YouTube Premium.</p><p>So, which is better?</p><p>YouTube Premium subscribers think it’s the better choice. For one, if you like entertainment from services like Hulu, Netflix, Disney, and much more, then YouTube Premium has you covered than YouTube TV.</p><h5 id="Q-A-Is-YouTube-Premium-subscription-available-in-all-countries"><a href="#Q-A-Is-YouTube-Premium-subscription-available-in-all-countries" class="headerlink" title="Q&amp;A: Is YouTube Premium subscription available in all countries?"></a>Q&amp;A: Is YouTube Premium subscription available in all countries?</h5><p>● YouTube Premium is not available in some countries. The likely reason is that those countries’ laws prevent it from being offered.</p><p>● But worry less, you can still access YouTube Premium even if it’s not available in your country. You can switch to an alternative county and stream videos.</p><ul><li>Make a quick switch by first clicking the “Country” button on the bottom of the YouTube homepage. Here, you’ll view various available countries where YouTube Premium is accessible.</li><li>Then click any country of choice to switch to. It will give you that country’s YouTube version.</li><li>You can also change your language if it presents a foreign language video and description. Just click on the “Language” button on the page.</li><li>Finally, access and play any YouTube premium video virtually from the country you switched to.</li></ul><h2 id="Is-YouTube-Premium-worth-subscribing-to"><a href="#Is-YouTube-Premium-worth-subscribing-to" class="headerlink" title="Is YouTube Premium worth subscribing to?"></a>Is YouTube Premium worth subscribing to?</h2><p>Even with the lack of YouTube Premium annual subscription, it still beats all odds to subscribe to this streaming service.</p><h4 id="1-Offline-playback"><a href="#1-Offline-playback" class="headerlink" title="1) Offline playback"></a>1) Offline playback</h4><p>Office playback is one reason why YouTube lovers opt for the Premium subscription. Saving your videos for offline listening gives you more advantages than needing to be online to stream your videos. You can do it by simply checking for the “Download” icon below the video you wish to save on your device for later watching. You are then free to stream your files at any time, on the go!</p><h4 id="2-Free-of-ads-at-last"><a href="#2-Free-of-ads-at-last" class="headerlink" title="2) Free of ads at last"></a>2) Free of ads at last</h4><p>YouTube streaming is much better without ever interacting with adverts. There are no pop-ups with the Premium version, letting you enjoy every bit of your video streaming. Again, such interruptions aren’t healthy for a tutorial session. Without ads, you can fully concentrate on video playing, letting you get quality value for your time.</p><h4 id="3-Get-original-content"><a href="#3-Get-original-content" class="headerlink" title="3) Get original content"></a>3) Get original content</h4><p>By fact, it is clear that this platform lets you interact with high-end artists who dwell on giving original content to their viewers. You’ll get a perfect chance to subscribe to artists who offer content, i.e., exclusive to the paid tier.</p><h4 id="4-Included-Google-Play-Music-for-free"><a href="#4-Included-Google-Play-Music-for-free" class="headerlink" title="4) Included Google Play Music for free"></a>4) Included Google Play Music for free</h4><p>It’s a double party for YouTube Premium subscribers. You have the advantage of getting Google Play Music when you subscribe to YouTube Music Premium. More so, the Google Play library gives you tones of music from their library.

It includes YouTube music and other features that Google added to it. You can download content, perform background playback and even get access to YouTube original content. Note that this came at a cost as its price was raised. But what remains is that you get value for your money.</p><h4 id="1-What-service-is-included-in-the-Premium-subscription-3"><a href="#1-What-service-is-included-in-the-Premium-subscription-3" class="headerlink" title="1. What service is included in the Premium subscription?"></a>1. What service is included in the Premium subscription?</h4><p>The Premium subscription is an after-sought service that includes these services.</p><p>Background play: It allows one to play your videos in the background, enabling you to use the app as a music player.</p><p>Offline playback: Easily view your videos on your phone or tablet. It means you can download a video or music and play them while not on the internet.</p><p>Ad-free videos: Say goodbye to popular ads with YouTube Free subscription. You already catered for your freedom in the subscription.</p><p>YouTube Music Premium: YouTube music is available for free even though you won’t download it for offline playback on this tier.</p><p>Flip between apps swiftly: Your videos will continue playing even if you switch to another app. You can flip apps on your device, like check emails, read Twitter, scroll to texts and still play your videos.</p><h4 id="2-The-price-of-a-YouTube-Premium-subscription-3"><a href="#2-The-price-of-a-YouTube-Premium-subscription-3" class="headerlink" title="2. The price of a YouTube Premium subscription"></a>2. The price of a YouTube Premium subscription</h4><p>YouTube Premium isn’t different from other services. Like most streaming services, you get family and student plans. YouTube Premium costs your $6.99 monthly subscription for students’ plans. You, however, need to verify that you are a student. A family plan comes at $17.99 per month, where you can add up to five members. Single YouTube Premium will cost you $11.99 a month</p><h4 id="3-Does-YouTube-Premium-provide-an-annual-plan-3"><a href="#3-Does-YouTube-Premium-provide-an-annual-plan-3" class="headerlink" title="3. Does YouTube Premium provide an annual plan?"></a>3. Does YouTube Premium provide an annual plan?</h4><p>No. YouTube Premium does not provide an annual plan. You can only pay your subscription per month.</p><h4 id="4-What-is-the-difference-between-YouTube-TV-and-YouTube-Premium-3"><a href="#4-What-is-the-difference-between-YouTube-TV-and-YouTube-Premium-3" class="headerlink" title="4. What is the difference between YouTube TV and YouTube Premium"></a>4. What is the difference between YouTube TV and YouTube Premium</h4><p>Even though they sound similar, YouTube TV and YouTube Premium are different in many aspects. While YouTube Premium is a paid subscription, YouTube TV is a live streaming service. Let’s explore more differences.</p><h5 id="What-is-included-3"><a href="#What-is-included-3" class="headerlink" title="What is included"></a>What is included</h5><p>If you subscribe to YouTube Premium, then you unlock other streaming features. These include watching YouTube without ads on its apps, managing offline viewing, playing your videos in the background, and getting YouTube Music, among others.</p><p>You can watch various channels over the internet with YouTube TV, live. It offers you close to 90 channels cutting across lifestyle, news, entertainment, sports, etc. Likewise, you can stream live broadcasts from top networks like NBC, FOX, ABC, etc. It will also splash your screen with news channels from BBC America, CNN, FOX News, etc.</p><h5 id="Cost-3"><a href="#Cost-3" class="headerlink" title="Cost"></a>Cost</h5><p>When it comes to pricing, YouTube Premium costs $11.00 per month with a free, one-month trial for new subscribers. It also has different plans for students and families. On the other hand, YouTube TV starts at $64.99 per month. However, first-time subscribers can get a free offer of up to one week at no cost. This rate may seem high, but it is competitive with other live TV streaming services.</p><h5 id="Accessibility-3"><a href="#Accessibility-3" class="headerlink" title="Accessibility"></a>Accessibility</h5><p>YouTube TV is readily available on the web, mobile platforms, and media streaming devices like Fire TV and Chromecast. You can also download the YouTube TV app to enjoy it on players like game consoles and PlayStations. For YouTube Premium, you’ll easily access it by subscription.</p><p>However, there are areas where both YouTube TV and YouTube Premium overlap. Both will let you watch YouTube Originals.</p><p>You will also enjoy your videos without adverts interruption. Additionally, it would be best to have an internet connection to stream your videos before downloading. And after downloading and saving your files, you can stream them offline on YouTube Premium.</p><p>So, which is better?</p><p>YouTube Premium subscribers think it’s the better choice. For one, if you like entertainment from services like Hulu, Netflix, Disney, and much more, then YouTube Premium has you covered than YouTube TV.</p><h5 id="Q-A-Is-YouTube-Premium-subscription-available-in-all-countries-3"><a href="#Q-A-Is-YouTube-Premium-subscription-available-in-all-countries-3" class="headerlink" title="Q&amp;A: Is YouTube Premium subscription available in all countries?"></a>Q&amp;A: Is YouTube Premium subscription available in all countries?</h5><p>● YouTube Premium is not available in some countries. The likely reason is that those countries’ laws prevent it from being offered.</p><p>● But worry less, you can still access YouTube Premium even if it’s not available in your country. You can switch to an alternative county and stream videos.</p><ul><li>Make a quick switch by first clicking the “Country” button on the bottom of the YouTube homepage. Here, you’ll view various available countries where YouTube Premium is accessible.</li><li>Then click any country of choice to switch to. It will give you that country’s YouTube version.</li><li>You can also change your language if it presents a foreign language video and description. Just click on the “Language” button on the page.</li><li>Finally, access and play any YouTube premium video virtually from the country you switched to.</li></ul><h2 id="Is-YouTube-Premium-worth-subscribing-to-3"><a href="#Is-YouTube-Premium-worth-subscribing-to-3" class="headerlink" title="Is YouTube Premium worth subscribing to?"></a>Is YouTube Premium worth subscribing to?</h2><p>Even with the lack of YouTube Premium annual subscription, it still beats all odds to subscribe to this streaming service.</p><h4 id="1-Offline-playback-3"><a href="#1-Offline-playback-3" class="headerlink" title="1) Offline playback"></a>1) Offline playback</h4><p>Office playback is one reason why YouTube lovers opt for the Premium subscription. Saving your videos for offline listening gives you more advantages than needing to be online to stream your videos. You can do it by simply checking for the “Download” icon below the video you wish to save on your device for later watching. You are then free to stream your files at any time, on the go!</p><h4 id="2-Free-of-ads-at-last-3"><a href="#2-Free-of-ads-at-last-3" class="headerlink" title="2) Free of ads at last"></a>2) Free of ads at last</h4><p>YouTube streaming is much better without ever interacting with adverts. There are no pop-ups with the Premium version, letting you enjoy every bit of your video streaming. Again, such interruptions aren’t healthy for a tutorial session. Without ads, you can fully concentrate on video playing, letting you get quality value for your time.</p><h4 id="3-Get-original-content-3"><a href="#3-Get-original-content-3" class="headerlink" title="3) Get original content"></a>3) Get original content</h4><p>By fact, it is clear that this platform lets you interact with high-end artists who dwell on giving original content to their viewers. You’ll get a perfect chance to subscribe to artists who offer content, i.e., exclusive to the paid tier.</p><h4 id="4-Included-Google-Play-Music-for-free-3"><a href="#4-Included-Google-Play-Music-for-free-3" class="headerlink" title="4) Included Google Play Music for free"></a>4) Included Google Play Music for free</h4><p>It’s a double party for YouTube Premium subscribers. You have the advantage of getting Google Play Music when you subscribe to YouTube Music Premium. More so, the Google Play library gives you tones of music from their library. Combined with YouTube Premium offers, you won’t have any reason not to feel entertained from any genre of choice.</p><h4 id="Some-improvements-will-go-a-long-way-3"><a href="#Some-improvements-will-go-a-long-way-3" class="headerlink" title="Some improvements will go a long way"></a>Some improvements will go a long way</h4><p>Despite all the reasons to subscribe to YouTube Premium, it still needs a minor improvement to perfection.</p><ul><li>The YouTube Premium service’s availability is limited compared to the initial YouTube version. Therefore, some countries prohibit its usage and are only accessible in about 70 countries. Hopefully, it will be available worldwide so that no user is limited.</li><li>YouTube Premium subscription does not give any discounts on any of the subscriptions. And being that it has no yearly subscriptions, the amount remains the same whether you opt for one month or pay it times 12 for the year. There should be some considerations for offers, primarily when you cover the one-year payments.</li><li>Some users feel the price is higher than other streaming services. However, YouTube claims to offer free Google Play music. Perhaps this is the reason for the slight rise.</li><li>This streaming service lacks some extras like rentals and charged station subscriptions. Other features like “lyrics” to the songs have also not been catered for. Likewise, some extra information like the title or genre of the video you watch is not included. These small extras could go a long way if they were to be added.</li><li>YouTube Premium also seems to pay attention to celebrities other than YouTubers. Most originals are not exclusive to Premium subscribers, while you can watch them with ads on a free account.</li></ul><h2 id="Conclusion-3"><a href="#Conclusion-3" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>● Amidst the many YouTube subscriptions, YouTube Premium has come a long way. Additionally, it hasn’t covered all the countries just yet. However, it has eliminated the presence of annoying ads that are prominent with the free YouTube service. More so, you get free access to Google Play Music, among other added values. Despite those, the app still needs some improvements in its services to incorporate YouTube Premium subscribers in its walk fully.</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://youtube-tips.techidaily.com/n-2024-the-ultimate-guide-to-years-top-makeup-vloggers/"><u>[New] In 2024, The Ultimate Guide to Year's Top Makeup Vloggers</u></a></li><li><a href="https://article-files.techidaily.com/new-in-2024-ultimate-list-top-10-subtitle-editors-web/"><u>[New] In 2024, Ultimate List Top 10 Subtitle Editors Web</u></a></li><li><a href="https://desktop-recording.techidaily.com/updated-audiovisual-success-recording-gotomeetings-easily/"><u>[Updated] Audiovisual Success Recording GoToMeetings Easily</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-tips.techidaily.com/ed-prime-10-youtube-historians-top-picks-for-learning-for-2024/"><u>[Updated] Prime 10 YouTube Historians’ Top Picks for Learning for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://visual-screen-recording.techidaily.com/updated-the-dos-and-donts-of-youtube-video-logging-for-2024/"><u>[Updated] The Do's and Don'ts of YouTube Video Logging for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://common-error.techidaily.com/deciphering-the-reason-behind-spontaneous-windows-11-bootups-a-comprehensive-guide/"><u>Deciphering the Reason Behind Spontaneous Windows 11 Bootups - A Comprehensive Guide</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-tips.techidaily.com/ng-your-next-big-idea-in-iconography-at-these-6-places/"><u>Finding Your Next Big Idea in Iconography at These 6 Places</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook.techidaily.com/forums-fade-away-here-are-6-reasons-why/"><u>Forums Fade Away, Here Are 6 Reasons Why</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fake-location.techidaily.com/ispoofer-is-not-working-on-samsung-galaxy-f34-5g-fixed-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/"><u>iSpoofer is not working On Samsung Galaxy F34 5G?

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="Profiting-From-Gaming-Channels"><a href="#Profiting-From-Gaming-Channels" class="headerlink" title="Profiting From Gaming Channels"></a>Profiting From Gaming Channels</h2><p>Gone is when playing video games was strictly for entertainment. These days, you can record and share your gaming skills on YouTube and earn a fortune. A good example is Techno Gamerz. This YouTube channel has over 29 million subscribers, and it’s believed to be among the fastest-growing channels in India. In fact, the channel recently crossed the 1 billion views mark.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/techno-gamerz-youtube-income-2022-1.jpg"                      alt="techno gamerz income ujjwal chaurasia"                ></p><p>Now, this begs the query; what is the <strong>Techno Gamerz income</strong> on YouTube? This article discusses everything you need to know about the young YouTube gamer, from his monthly and yearly payments to his net worth.</p><p><strong>Meta Description</strong>: This article discusses the brains behind the popular Techno Gamerz YouTube channel. You’ll learn about the Techno Gamerz income, age, gender, nationality, and more.</p><blockquote><p> Disclaimer: This post includes affiliate links</p><p> If you click on a link and make a purchase, I may receive a commission at no extra cost to you.</p></blockquote><h2 id="Part-1-Summary-Box-on-Techno-Gamerz"><a href="#Part-1-Summary-Box-on-Techno-Gamerz" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: Summary Box on Techno Gamerz"></a>Part 1: Summary Box on Techno Gamerz</h2><table><thead><tr><th>Name</th><th>Ujjwal Chaurasia</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Net worth in USD (2022)</td><td>$2 million</td></tr><tr><td>Monthly income and salary</td><td>RS.15 Lakh+</td></tr><tr><td>Yearly income and salary</td><td>1.5 Crore</td></tr><tr><td>Age</td><td>20 years (born January 12, 2002)</td></tr><tr><td>Gender</td><td>Male</td></tr><tr><td>Nationality</td><td>Indian</td></tr><tr><td>Height</td><td>5.5 inches</td></tr><tr><td>Profession</td><td>YouTuber</td></tr><tr><td>YouTube channel</td><td>Techno Gamerz</td></tr><tr><td>Awards and recognition</td><td>Diamond, Gold, and Silver play buttons</td></tr></tbody></table><p>Up to this point, you should have a brief overview of who Techno Gamerz is and what he does to earn such staggering figures on YouTube. So, the next section discusses his income in detail and what makes this YouTuber so famous. Keep reading!</p><h2 id="Part-2-Techno-Gamerz-YouTube-Earning-and-Stats"><a href="#Part-2-Techno-Gamerz-YouTube-Earning-and-Stats" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: Techno Gamerz YouTube Earning and Stats"></a>Part 2: Techno Gamerz YouTube Earning and Stats</h2><p>Ujjwal Chaurasia, alias Techno Gamerz, was born and grew up in New Delhi, India. The charismatic vlogger first joined YouTube on August 13, 2017, and uploaded his first gaming video on January 2018. Initially, Ujjwal used his elder brother’s phone to post gaming tutorial videos. This obviously limited his input on YouTube as he also had to set aside time for studying.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/techno-gamerz-youtube-income-2022-2.jpg"                      alt="techno gamerz youtube marketing"                ></p><p>But after seeing potential in what Techno Gamerz was doing, his brother encouraged him to post more often. His first viral video was for Dragon Ball Z, a downloading tutorial. This video garnered a massive 250K views, boosting his channel’s profile. The young YouTube star has never looked back since then.</p><p>Meantime, you must be asking yourself how YouTube generates income in India. It’s simple; via AdSense! YouTube’s RPM (Revenue Per Mile) metric per 1,000 views varies between countries. In India, the video-sharing platform pays $0.50 per 1,000 views. This means that Indian YouTube teachers and influencers can earn $500 after garnering 1 million views.</p><p>But nothing is cast in stone on YouTube. Most Indian channels can earn between $800 and $2,500 after reaching 1 million views. However, this depends on where you get the most views from. For example, if at least half of your views are from the US, you’ll earn at least $1,500. <strong>Techno Gamerz YouTube income</strong> per 1,000 views is approximately $1.21.</p><p>Remember that there are some conditions to meet before you start earning money on YouTube. First, the channel must be active for at least a year and have a minimum of 1,000 subscribers. That’s not all; you’ll need nothing less than 4,000 watch hours to be on YouTube’s payroll.</p><p>With that said, below are some YouTube stats about the <strong>Techno Gamerz monthly income</strong>, number of views, and more:</p><table><thead><tr><th>Estimated Monthly earnings in USD&#x2F;Indian rupees</th><th>$167K</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Estimated Yearly earnings in USD&#x2F;Indian rupees</td><td>$8.6 million</td></tr><tr><td>Total video uploads</td><td>858</td></tr><tr><td>Type of videos</td><td>Gaming tutorials</td></tr><tr><td>Subscribers</td><td>29 million</td></tr><tr><td>Video views</td><td>7.5 billion</td></tr><tr><td>Last 30 days’ views</td><td>7 million</td></tr></tbody></table><p>As expected, Ujjwal Chaurasia has a massive following on other social media platforms, especially on Instagram. Here, the 20-year-old has more than 2 million followers and over 250K likes on “ujjwalgamer.” He usually posts selfies, pictures, and a few gaming contents on Instagram. Ujjwal’s engagement rate on Instagram is around 12.5%.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/techno-gamerz-youtube-income-2022-3.jpg"                      alt="techno gamerz instagram"                ></p><p>He also has another Instagram account called “<a class="link"   href="https://www.instagram.com/techno%5Fgamerz/" >Techno_Gamerz <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>,” which has over 1M followers and over 120K likes. Ujjwal uses this account to keep his followers abreast of what’s happening on his YouTube channel and give hints of future releases. He also posts subscriber milestones. His Twitter account is “<a class="link"   href="https://twitter.com/UjjwalGamer" >Ujjwal Chaurasia <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>,” with over 116K followers and around 290 posts.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/techno-gamerz-youtube-income-2022-4.jpg"                      alt="techno gamerz instagram and twitter homepage"                ></p><p>Ujjwal is also venturing into music lately, specifically Hip Hop. He partnered with one of India’s most prominent producers, Sez on the Beat, to release Game On. This music tells a tale of how Chaurasia started from zero subscribers to more than 10 million. Currently, this single boasts over 62 million views.</p><h2 id="Part-3-Why-Is-Techno-Gamerz-Trending-on-YouTube"><a href="#Part-3-Why-Is-Techno-Gamerz-Trending-on-YouTube" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: Why Is Techno Gamerz Trending on YouTube?"></a>Part 3: Why Is Techno Gamerz Trending on YouTube?</h2><p>The <strong>Techno Gamerz earnings</strong> are certainly no fluke. Many YouTube careers come crashing down before they even start. You’ll even need to congratulate yourself for earning just $100 on YouTube. So, what makes Techno Gamers a darling to many YouTubers?</p><p><strong>1. Engaging and interactive videos</strong></p><p>YouTube is a very competitive video-sharing platform, and Techno Gamerz knows this fact quite well. Techno Gamerz adds funny and interactive commentary to his YouTube gaming videos to make them more interactive. Many YouTubers also love his confidence and composure in front of the camera.</p><p><strong>2. Captivating story and continuity</strong></p><p>One major thing you’ll see about all of Techno Gamerz’s videos is continuity. The YouTuber churns out new content every couple of days, keeping his fans entertained at all times. Also, Techno Gamerz always does a recap on his previous episodes to ensure that viewers can keep up with the pace. He even admitted in an interview that it’s critical for his audience to follow the storyline, making watching series like GTA V more interesting.</p><p><strong>3. Single and multiplayer tutorials</strong></p><p>Techno Gamerz’s tutorials consist of single and multiplayer games. He says that single-player games bring out his character’s awesomely powerful and superior side. He also admitted that he loves multiplayer games’ unpredictable and challenging nature.</p><p><strong>Something about Techno Gamerz’s most loved videos</strong></p><p>As said before, Dragon Ball Z was the YouTuber’s first upload on the platform. Then in January 2018, he went ahead to upload PUBG videos, but his breakthrough came when he switched to GTA. Up to now, he has posted 140+ GTA 5 episodes, which are famous for their unique storylines. Interestingly, each of his GTA videos has 5+ million views.</p><p>But to be one of the most popular YouTubers, you’ll need diversity. Techno Gamerz has this in abundance. His “Grandpa and Granny Two Hunters” video has 10+ million views. It’s a horror game where Techno Gamerz plays the scary granny with insane tricks.</p><p>His other videos, “BeamNG” and “Just Draw,” have more than 12 million and 13 million views, respectively. GTA V is the most loved by his audience, with over 30 million views.</p><h2 id="Bonus-Tip-How-To-Be-a-YouTuber-and-Make-Videos-Like-Techno-Gamerz"><a href="#Bonus-Tip-How-To-Be-a-YouTuber-and-Make-Videos-Like-Techno-Gamerz" class="headerlink" title="Bonus Tip: How To Be a YouTuber and Make Videos Like Techno Gamerz"></a>Bonus Tip: How To Be a YouTuber and Make Videos Like Techno Gamerz</h2><p>Evidently, you need to create compelling videos to increase your chances of getting over 1 million views and matching the <strong>Techno Gamerz salary</strong>. So, what makes a great YouTube video? The perfect YouTube videos should have a catchy intro, voice overlays, picture-in-picture effects, background audio, and more. You can also include elements like timers, subtitles, and effect overlays.</p><p>Thankfully, <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Wondershare Filmora <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> comes with all these features and many more.

The charismatic vlogger first joined YouTube on August 13, 2017, and uploaded his first gaming video on January 2018. Initially, Ujjwal used his elder brother’s phone to post gaming tutorial videos. This obviously limited his input on YouTube as he also had to set aside time for studying.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/techno-gamerz-youtube-income-2022-2.jpg"                      alt="techno gamerz youtube marketing"                ></p><p>But after seeing potential in what Techno Gamerz was doing, his brother encouraged him to post more often. His first viral video was for Dragon Ball Z, a downloading tutorial. This video garnered a massive 250K views, boosting his channel’s profile. The young YouTube star has never looked back since then.</p><p>Meantime, you must be asking yourself how YouTube generates income in India. It’s simple; via AdSense! YouTube’s RPM (Revenue Per Mile) metric per 1,000 views varies between countries. In India, the video-sharing platform pays $0.50 per 1,000 views. This means that Indian YouTube teachers and influencers can earn $500 after garnering 1 million views.</p><p>But nothing is cast in stone on YouTube. Most Indian channels can earn between $800 and $2,500 after reaching 1 million views. However, this depends on where you get the most views from. For example, if at least half of your views are from the US, you’ll earn at least $1,500. <strong>Techno Gamerz YouTube income</strong> per 1,000 views is approximately $1.21.</p><p>Remember that there are some conditions to meet before you start earning money on YouTube. First, the channel must be active for at least a year and have a minimum of 1,000 subscribers. That’s not all; you’ll need nothing less than 4,000 watch hours to be on YouTube’s payroll.</p><p>With that said, below are some YouTube stats about the <strong>Techno Gamerz monthly income</strong>, number of views, and more:</p><table><thead><tr><th>Estimated Monthly earnings in USD&#x2F;Indian rupees</th><th>$167K</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Estimated Yearly earnings in USD&#x2F;Indian rupees</td><td>$8.6 million</td></tr><tr><td>Total video uploads</td><td>858</td></tr><tr><td>Type of videos</td><td>Gaming tutorials</td></tr><tr><td>Subscribers</td><td>29 million</td></tr><tr><td>Video views</td><td>7.5 billion</td></tr><tr><td>Last 30 days’ views</td><td>7 million</td></tr></tbody></table><p>As expected, Ujjwal Chaurasia has a massive following on other social media platforms, especially on Instagram. Here, the 20-year-old has more than 2 million followers and over 250K likes on “ujjwalgamer.” He usually posts selfies, pictures, and a few gaming contents on Instagram. Ujjwal’s engagement rate on Instagram is around 12.5%.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/techno-gamerz-youtube-income-2022-3.jpg"                      alt="techno gamerz instagram"                ></p><p>He also has another Instagram account called “<a class="link"   href="https://www.instagram.com/techno%5Fgamerz/" >Techno_Gamerz <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>,” which has over 1M followers and over 120K likes.

Very few people know to add outro to YouTube videos is the best YouTube SEO technique.</p><p>In this guide, I’ll demystify what YouTube outro is and how to make outro and add it to a YouTube video. If you are not a tech expert, use intro and outro makers highlighted herein to make your videos as interactive pas possible.</p><p>To get a sneak preview of what is entailed here; this guide has been subdivided into five parts:</p><ul><li><a href="#part1">Part 1: YouTube Outro Prerequisites</a></li><li><a href="#part2">Part 2: Best 8 Intro And Outro Makers For YouTube</a></li><li><a href="#part3">Part 3: How To Make And Add Outro To YouTube Video</a></li><li><a href="#part4">Part 4: How To Add An Outro To A Youtube Video</a></li><li><a href="#part5">Part 5: Frequently Asked Questions about YouTube Outro</a></li></ul><blockquote><p> Disclaimer: This post includes affiliate links</p><p> If you click on a link and make a purchase, I may receive a commission at no extra cost to you.</p></blockquote><h2 id="Part-1-YouTube-Outro-Prerequisites"><a href="#Part-1-YouTube-Outro-Prerequisites" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: YouTube Outro Prerequisites"></a>Part 1: YouTube Outro Prerequisites</h2><p>In this part, we will learn what outros for YouTube are, the importance of land that distinguishes them from the intro. Also included are expert tips on how to make YouTube outro that attracts a hundred thousand subscribers in seven days included.</p><p>To understand what YouTube outro is and why you should add it to your videos, here is a detailed explanation.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/youtube-outro-guide.jpg"                      alt="youtube outro making guide"                ></p><h2 id="Section-1-What-is-a-Youtube-Outro"><a href="#Section-1-What-is-a-Youtube-Outro" class="headerlink" title="Section 1: What is a Youtube Outro?"></a>Section 1: What is a Youtube Outro?</h2><p>YouTube outro aka end screen is the last part of a video with a call to action statement, button or video suggestion to view other YouTube videos. In other words, it’s the last part of a video with calls to action links.</p><p>One of the most effective technical methods of optimizing YouTube videos is by adding an outro. This helps attract huge traffic, increase conversion and engage viewers.</p><p>Why spend your time adding outro? You can add Outro to YouTube videos to direct viewers to your website, other selected videos, engage viewers for longer and to persuade them to subscribe to the channel. In short, most end screens have four elements incorporated into an outro: Channel, subscribe, Video playlist and a website link.</p><h2 id="Section-2-Difference-Between-Outro-and-Intro"><a href="#Section-2-Difference-Between-Outro-and-Intro" class="headerlink" title="Section 2: Difference Between Outro and Intro"></a>Section 2: Difference Between Outro and Intro</h2><p>Most YouTube videos have an intro and an outro. In this case, an intro is a short clip at the beginning of a YouTube video that introduces you to the viewers and your brand.</p><p>Even though video creators attach more emphasis on intros, both are both very critical. For your videos to achieve meaningful results, it’s important to view each as distinct from the other. Equally important to know, both intros and outros have different purposes.</p><table><thead><tr><th>Differences Between YouTube Intro And Outro</th><th></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Intro</td><td>Outro</td></tr><tr><td>Inserted at the begging of a video</td><td>Inserted at the end of a video</td></tr><tr><td>Used to capture audience attention</td><td>Directs the audience to the next step</td></tr><tr><td>Introduces the topic</td><td>Suggests new topics to viewers</td></tr><tr><td>Attract viewers to the video</td><td>Contains a call-action button</td></tr><tr><td>Showcases a brand, logo, business slogan or a statement mission</td><td></td></tr></tbody></table><h2 id="Section-3-YouTube-Outro-Requirements"><a href="#Section-3-YouTube-Outro-Requirements" class="headerlink" title="Section 3: YouTube Outro Requirements"></a>Section 3: YouTube Outro Requirements</h2><p>Just as their requirements for any video uploaded on YouTube, outros are no exception. For your outro to be interactive, observe the following requirements:</p><p><strong>1. Outro Resolution</strong></p><p>Outros for YouTube should have an aspect ratio of 16:9 and a resolution of 1920px X 1080px.</p><p><strong>2. Outro Element Sizes and Dimensions</strong></p><p>End screen templates comprise elements that are in different shapes and sizes. When using a YouTube outro size of 1920px X 1080px, here are the element dimensions to use:</p><ul><li>Subscribe – 294px X 294px</li><li>Channel – 294px X 294px</li><li>Website link - 294px X 294px</li><li>Video playlist – 615px X 345px</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/youtube-outro-dimensions.jpg"                      alt="youtube outro screen format"                ></p><p><strong>3. Outro Length</strong></p><p>If you want to make your outro boring, make it long. So, how long should YouTube outro be? For your outros to have a high conversation rate, they should be approximately 10-20 seconds long. However, the length of your video should be the determining factor. A one-hour YouTube video can have a longer outro.</p><p>Don’t be challenged by setting the above sizes because nearly all intro and outro makers have already set dimensions for the elements. The major requirements are done for you</p><h2 id="Section-4-Best-Practices-When-Making-A-YouTube-Outro"><a href="#Section-4-Best-Practices-When-Making-A-YouTube-Outro" class="headerlink" title="Section 4: Best Practices When Making A YouTube Outro"></a>Section 4: Best Practices When Making A YouTube Outro</h2><p>Imagine given 10 seconds to showcase your YouTube channel and direct viewers on the next move without breaking the engagement!

Try to align your thoughts with those of the viewer.</p><p>Every video creator wishes for the following goals, increasing your channel subscribers, sending traffic to another site, viewing more videos and sharing to social media. Each YouTube outro element should have its own goal.</p><ol><li><strong>Simple, clear and easy to interpret</strong></li></ol><p>Your outro will be meaningless if the audience cannot take action due to the complexity of either the language used or the ambiguity of words used. Use colors that pop out the elements making them the center of focus. Make them clear and avoid anything distractive.</p><ol><li><strong>Use similar outro templates</strong></li></ol><p>Apart from being a good method of branding your channel, using similar outro on your videos adds credibility.

Of the major developments made in the recent past is the introduction of Shorts. These short vertical videos have grown in popularity as more people view videos on their phones. With this development, the <strong>YouTube Shorts fund</strong> was launched to reward creators for their efforts. The fund allows creators to monetize their Shorts quickly, supporting and incentivizing them to create high-quality Shorts content. In this article, we will explore the YouTube Shorts Fund 2023, including YouTube shorts fund eligibility.</p><p><strong>YouTube Shorts Monetization</strong> A cross-platform for taking your overexposed footage to cinema-quality Shorts video!</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Free Download <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Free Download <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Learn More <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/banner/filmora-latest-product-box.png"                      alt="Wondershare Filmora 12"                ></p><blockquote><p> Disclaimer: This post includes affiliate links</p><p> If you click on a link and make a purchase, I may receive a commission at no extra cost to you.</p></blockquote><h2 id="Part-1-YouTube-Shorts-Fund-Introduction-and-Benefits"><a href="#Part-1-YouTube-Shorts-Fund-Introduction-and-Benefits" class="headerlink" title="Part 1. YouTube Shorts Fund: Introduction and Benefits"></a><strong>Part 1. YouTube Shorts Fund: Introduction and Benefits</strong></h2><p>YouTube launched YouTube Shorts Funds in 2021 to financially support creators who produce engaging and popular Shorts content. The monetization scheme would distribute $100 million to high-performing creators on the platform. The creators would receive high engagement and views from their Shorts for funding.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/everything-you-need-to-know-about-the-youtube-shorts-fund-1.jpeg"                      alt="youtube shorts fund"                ></p><p>The main objective of the YouTube Shorts fund is to encourage creativity, diversity, and innovation in Shorts content creation. The fund operated between 2021 and 2022. It lets creators earn $100 - $10,000 a month for their content.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/everything-you-need-to-know-about-the-youtube-shorts-fund-2.jpeg"                      alt="youtube shorts fund earnings"                ></p><p>Participating in YouTube Shorts Funds offer several benefits to the creators:</p><ul><li><strong>Additional Exposure:</strong> YouTube Shorts are predominately featured on the homepage, allowing creators to reach more people.</li><li><strong>Recognition:</strong> YouTube recognizes top Shorts creators through the Shorts Funding program, encouraging them to create more quality content.</li><li><strong>Potential Earnings</strong>: Creators can monetize their Shorts content in several ways including adding and other unique features.</li></ul><p>YouTube incorporated monetization of Shorts in its YouTube Partner Program (YPP). Therefore, YouTube merged the Shorts Fund with the YPP in February 2023. This led to YouTube Shorts Fund 2023 which now offers creators more opportunities to make money quickly on YouTube.</p><h2 id="Part-2-Making-Money-with-YouTube-Shorts-Eligibility-and-Earnings"><a href="#Part-2-Making-Money-with-YouTube-Shorts-Eligibility-and-Earnings" class="headerlink" title="Part 2. Making Money with YouTube Shorts: Eligibility and Earnings"></a><strong>Part 2. Making Money with YouTube Shorts: Eligibility and Earnings</strong></h2><p>The new YouTube Shorts monetization policy means that content creators on YouTube with access to the YPP can also earn from Shorts. The revenue-sharing model has now taken the place of the YouTube Shorts Fund, which only rewarded creators using YouTube’s money. However, creators don’t have to be members of the YPP to start receiving YouTube Shorts funding. They only need to meet certain requirements, make unique content, and adhere to Community Guidelines.</p><ul><li><a href="#youtube1">YouTube Shorts Fund Eligibility</a></li><li><a href="#youtube2">Additional Steps of Actions to Activate YouTube Shorts Funding</a></li><li><a href="#youtube3">What the YPP Shorts Fund Entails</a></li><li><a href="#youtube4">How Much Can You Make with Short</a></li></ul><h3 id="YouTube-Shorts-Fund-Eligibility"><a href="#YouTube-Shorts-Fund-Eligibility" class="headerlink" title="YouTube Shorts Fund Eligibility"></a><strong>YouTube Shorts Fund Eligibility</strong></h3><p>As of 2023, YouTube offers Shorts Funding as a monetization option.

It can be hard to make decent money on Shorts sometimes, and other times it brings in a nice chunk of revenue. Unfortunately, the earnings are not as spectacular as the long YouTube videos.

Licenses have conditions, but they should not affect your ability to use royalty free music in your vlog. The most common condition for using royalty free music is that you need to credit the artist, which can be as simple as including a ‘music by’ note in your video’s description.</p><p>Because royalty free music still has a copyright claim on it YouTube may occasionally flag your video even though you are only using music you are allowed to use. YouTube’s flagging system is automated and prone to error. If your video is incorrectly flagged you can dispute it with YouTube and get your video cleared again.</p><p><a href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-win.jpg"                      alt="Download Win Version"                ></a><a href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-mac.jpg"                      alt="Download Mac Version"                ></a></p><h2 id="Part-2-10-Best-Royalty-Free-Music-for-YouTube-Videos"><a href="#Part-2-10-Best-Royalty-Free-Music-for-YouTube-Videos" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: 10 Best Royalty Free Music for YouTube Videos"></a>Part 2: 10 Best Royalty Free Music for YouTube Videos</h2><h3 id="1-YouTube-Audio-Library"><a href="#1-YouTube-Audio-Library" class="headerlink" title="1.

It is understandable that there will be a learning curve if you just want to get tons of subscribers on your channel – who doesn’t? Ultimately, in getting a standard video that will attract and sustain the interest of the viewers, you will need to employ certain strategies that will enhance your credibility.</p><p>Let’s tell each other the truth, no one wants to watch a video that is not aesthetically appealing even if it is a close friend. So, if you have got the relevant content and the video to pull traffic to your channel, what you will need is editing software that will help you make the correct adjustments to your video</p><p>Nobody wants a random viewer to comment “This video is a little bit tacky, touch-up properly”, that will definitely leave a sting. As such, understand the best technique that works for you as well as the software that meets your needs based on the current level of expertise. It is okay for you to grow.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/Mac-articles/advanced%20video%20cutter.png"                      alt="advanced%20video%20cutter"                ></p><blockquote><p> Disclaimer: This post includes affiliate links</p><p> If you click on a link and make a purchase, I may receive a commission at no extra cost to you.</p></blockquote><h2 id="Five-Video-Cutting-Skills-Youtubers-Must-Have"><a href="#Five-Video-Cutting-Skills-Youtubers-Must-Have" class="headerlink" title="Five Video Cutting Skills Youtubers Must Have"></a>Five Video Cutting Skills Youtubers Must Have</h2><p>As much as the enthusiasm is brewing to get on your mac and upload the video you just shot, there are certain elements you need to implement to make a cool video for YouTube. Beginners sometimes feel their content is the best, the excitement of posting their very first series can be overwhelming. Sometimes, it blocks off other ideas for making the video better.</p><p>However, having amazing content dies not to exclude the need for the right editing technique. Here are five methods for editing your YouTube videos:</p><h3 id="1-Control-the-video-duration"><a href="#1-Control-the-video-duration" class="headerlink" title="1.Control the video duration"></a>1.Control the video duration</h3><p>The length of a particular scene can have different meanings depending on how long or short it is in a video. This means the duration can impact the message you are trying to pass across to your viewers, hence it is important to know what places to accelerate and cut in the video.</p><p>You can have a system where each part of the content is labeled in their order of importance such as A, B, C. This means from the most important to the least important. Consequently, you will be able to sieve through the content and make the appropriate changes while editing the video.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/filmora-mac-change-default-transition-duration.jpg"                                     ></p><h3 id="2-Customize-the-intro-and-end-of-the-video"><a href="#2-Customize-the-intro-and-end-of-the-video" class="headerlink" title="2.Customize the intro and end of the video"></a>2.Customize the intro and end of the video</h3><p>It is possible to grab the attention of the viewer in the intro and even more likely to lose someone once the opening montage comes in. Creating an intro that is captivating and appealing to drag the audience to your video is an important technique for editing your videos. Also, the end of the video, from the signing out to the closing montage has to appeal to the audience. You will be surprised by the number of people that love seeing end credits if the closing montage is good. Customize the intro and the end of the video so the audience is tuned all through.</p><p>You May Like: <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Best YouTube Banner Size and Channel Art Dimension (The Ultimate Guide) <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>You May Like: <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >How to Add Logo or Watermark to YouTube Video <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://zebaoaffiliateprogram.pxf.io/c/5597632/2137975/21526" target="_top" id="2137975">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/21526-2137975" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://zebaoaffiliateprogram.pxf.io/i/5597632/2137975/21526"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="3-Use-Cool-transitions-or-filters"><a href="#3-Use-Cool-transitions-or-filters" class="headerlink" title="3.Use Cool transitions or filters"></a>3.Use Cool transitions or filters</h3><p>If there is anything the audience love to see, it is the way you move from different points in the vudeo.

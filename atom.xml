Let’s discuss this scenario in detail in this article!</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/youtube-shorts-vs-tiktok.jpg"                      alt="filmora"                ></p><p>YouTube’s TikTok competitor, YouTube Shorts, is now rocking globally. Seeing the success of Instagram Reels and TikTok, it seems like YouTube didn’t want to lag behind the game. So in September last year, it decided to step into short-form content via YouTube Shorts, a social platform for quick 60-second videos hosted on the YouTube app.</p><p>According to the Shorts product lead <strong>Todd Sherman</strong>, the social media giant aims to unleash new grounds for creativity.</p><p>On the other hand, TikTok is a short-form, video-sharing app that assists users to share and make 15-second to 60-seconds videos on any topic.</p><p>TikTok contains a separate app for the Chinese market, <strong>Douyin</strong>, with 300 million-plus active monthly users. The new app’s logo is a merger of the Duyin and Musical.ly logos.</p><p>And, we’re going to discuss the comparison of both these giants, i.e., <strong>YouTube</strong> <strong>Shorts vs. TikTok</strong>, in terms of which app is better for making short videos.</p><blockquote><p> Disclaimer: This post includes affiliate links</p><p> If you click on a link and make a purchase, I may receive a commission at no extra cost to you.</p></blockquote><h2 id="Part-1-Is-YouTube-Shorts-the-New-TikTok"><a href="#Part-1-Is-YouTube-Shorts-the-New-TikTok" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: Is YouTube Shorts the New TikTok?"></a>Part 1: Is YouTube Shorts the New TikTok?</h2><p>In general, we can’t say that YouTube Shorts is the new TikTok because YouTube Shorts is YouTube’s expansion and have its own identity than TikTok.</p><p>YouTube Shorts is playing hand in hand with TikTok as the short-form video platform, but the Shorts integration with the broader ecosystem of YouTube is its key selling point according to Google’s service.</p><p>Ironically, while YouTube is laying ways to emulate TikTok’s format, TikTok is experimenting with formats that are closer to YouTube’s traditional focus. This is why TikTok has tripled its maximum video length to three minutes for everyone and has been developing apps slowly on TV platforms like Fire TV and Android TV.</p><p>At a glance, YouTube Shorts looks pretty similar to TikTok. However, there are certain TikTok features that even the Shorts product manager Todd Sherman disagrees with is that of the YouTube Shorts. Sherman said the way TikTok works is quite an industry-wide standard than the point of view of any single app.</p><p>Even though YouTube is quite late to the short-form content game, it has a strong brand of YouTube behind it.</p><p>Thus, saying that “YouTube Shorts is the new TikTok” doesn’t even qualify in terms of the $100 million fund sanctioned for the creators of YouTube Shorts.</p><h2 id="Part-2-YouTube-Shorts-vs-TikTok-What-Are-the-Similarities-and-Differences"><a href="#Part-2-YouTube-Shorts-vs-TikTok-What-Are-the-Similarities-and-Differences" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: YouTube Shorts vs. TikTok: What Are the Similarities and Differences?"></a>Part 2: YouTube Shorts vs. TikTok: What Are the Similarities and Differences?</h2><p>In this section, we’ve defined the analysis of <strong>YouTube Shorts vs. TikTok</strong> in the form of both a comparison table and specific points of similarities and differences.</p><table><thead><tr><th><strong>Basis of Comparison</strong></th><th><strong>YouTube Shorts</strong></th><th><strong>TikTok</strong></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><strong>Video Length&#x2F;Duration</strong></td><td>Up to 60 seconds</td><td>Up to 3 minutes</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Aspect Ratio</strong></td><td>9:16</td><td>9:16</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Video Captions&#x2F;Description</strong></td><td>You can find the video title in the exact location as the TikTok caption, but the description is visible only after users click on the three dots.</td><td>Video captions are located at the bottom left.</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Placement of Analytics</strong></td><td>YouTube Studio</td><td>TikTok app itself</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Dislike Button</strong></td><td>Yes</td><td>No</td></tr></tbody></table><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2043594/7443" target="_top" id="2043594">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2043594" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2043594/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="Section-1-The-Similarities-Between-YouTube-Shorts-and-TikTok"><a href="#Section-1-The-Similarities-Between-YouTube-Shorts-and-TikTok" class="headerlink" title="Section 1.

The Similarities Between YouTube Shorts and TikTok</h3><ul><li>Both these platforms are for short-form video content.</li><li>The TikTok and YouTube Shorts both assist creators in adding music from their audio libraries, and users can view all videos beneath the audio library.</li><li>Both offer analytics, including video views, likes, comments, watch time, shares, impressions, and reach. You can view these analytics on a desktop or mobile device for both platforms.</li><li>The Shorts and TikTok feed provide a full-screen immersive experience with the engagement menu shown on the right-hand panel.</li><li>Their feeds scroll in the same manner.

The Differences Between YouTube Shorts and TikTok"></a>Section 2. The Differences Between YouTube Shorts and TikTok</h3><ul><li>The monetization features of both these platforms are entirely different. Shorts offer their ‘Shorts fund,’ whereas TikTok provides Shoutouts and Digital Gifts.</li><li>Shorts can only be 60-seconds long, whereas TikTok’s can be as long as three minutes (it could soon be stretched to five minutes duration as per their recent test).</li><li>TikTok allows users to add video captions that are present in the bottom left area of TikTok. At the same time, users can add a video title in Shorts which is present in the exact location as a TikTok caption. And, a video description that is only viewable when users click the three dots above the link button and click ‘Description’ can be in YouTube Shorts.</li><li>YouTube has a large music library which gives users an abundance of undiscovered and popular songs to select from, possibly more than the TikTok offerings list.</li><li>TikTok has a vast library of filters, including greenscreen and AR effects, whereas Shorts only provides filters that edit the video’s tone, temperature, brightness, etc.</li><li>Shorts’ ‘private’ video option allows creators to choose or see who watches your video. On the other hand, TikTok’s ‘private’ video option only allows the creator to view the video.</li><li>You can view the TikTok analytics directly in the TikTok app. On the other hand, YouTube Shorts analytics can be visible in YouTube Studio.</li></ul><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/2135361/19272" target="_top" id="2135361">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-2135361" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/2135361/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="Features-TikTok-has-but-YouTube-Shorts-does-not…"><a href="#Features-TikTok-has-but-YouTube-Shorts-does-not…" class="headerlink" title="Features TikTok has, but YouTube Shorts does not…"></a>Features TikTok has, but YouTube Shorts does not…</h3><ul><li>A stitch and duet feature, where users can add other creators’ videos to their accounts.</li><li>A Q&amp;A feature to leave questions for creators to answer with a video.

Thus, even though it keeps up the promise of creating, watching, and sharing both long and short-form content, it may turn away those who prefer focused access to quick content. Regardless, with YouTube Shorts now starting to become available to more users, the battle in the viral video market with TikTok is sure to heat up.</p><p>Before giving you our opinion on which is the better platform for short video promotion, go through the following conversation first.</p><p>Ramona Pringle is an associate professor and a tech expert at Toronto’s Ryerson University. She said in an interview that because YouTube already has figured out video content, the transformation to add short-form video will be natural.</p><p>She also mentioned that YouTube Shorts is the platform best placed with the competition from TikTok than all other platforms. However, YouTube doesn’t need to be TikTok as it has its strategies and broad audience base.</p><p>Like Pringle, Matt Navarra, a social media consultant based in the U.K., said in an interview that Shorts is a logical evolution and extension of YouTube, which has further given rise to TikTok. But unlike TikTok, Shorts has a few features that it can take benefit from. Among these features is the extensive audio library content, the greater scope for users to remix and create duets and stuff from scratch. Undoubtedly, you can’t deny the experience of YouTube in terms of access to partnerships with the music industry and licensing.</p><p>Thus, keeping all these factors in mind, we’d like to conclude that both the YouTube Shorts and TikTok are great and considerable platforms for short video promotion. Still, we’d like to place YouTube Shorts in the upper place due to its global availability. Whereas TikTok is already banned in certain countries.</p><p>It also depends upon the audience base of the country as to which platform is in use the most. Suppose it’s TikTok that people primarily use in a particular country or location where the brand wants to advertise itself. In that case, going with TikTok for short video promotion is better and vice versa.</p><p>To get more information, click the following video!</p><h3 id="TikTok-or-YouTube-Creators-at-VidCon-2023-Reveal-Their-Platform-of-Choice"><a href="#TikTok-or-YouTube-Creators-at-VidCon-2023-Reveal-Their-Platform-of-Choice" class="headerlink" title="TikTok or YouTube?

Creators at VidCon 2023 Reveal Their Platform of Choice</h3><h4 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h4><p>So, this is our detailed overview of <strong>YouTube Shorts vs. TikTok</strong>.</p><p>Since YouTube wants its new platform to progress and stand a chance in front of TikTok, they will make Shorts a priority, and thus much more likely to promote it to a broad audience.</p><p>As we step further into the year, it is yet to consider which short-form video platform will be popular among the creators, marketers, and consumers.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/shannon-cox.jpg"                      alt="author avatar"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2037345/7443" target="_top" id="2037345">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2037345" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2037345/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p>Shanoon Cox</p><p>Shanoon Cox is a writer and a lover of all things video.</p><p>Follow @Shanoon Cox</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://youtube-tips.techidaily.com/n-2024-streamline-profitability-on-yt-post-monetization-financial-steps/"><u>[New] In 2024, Streamline Profitability on YT – Post-Monetization Financial Steps</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-tips.techidaily.com/n-2024-the-best-free-video-editing-software-for-youtube-top-8-reviews/"><u>[New] In 2024, The Best Free Video Editing Software for YouTube (Top 8 Reviews)</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-tips.techidaily.com/n-2024-top-8-platforms-for-linux-video-buffs/"><u>[New] In 2024, Top 8 Platforms for Linux Video Buffs</u></a></li><li><a href="https://some-skills.techidaily.com/new-unlock-full-potential-integrating-zoom-and-fb-live-events/"><u>[New] Unlock Full Potential Integrating ZOOM and FB Live Events</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-tips.techidaily.com/ed-2024-approved-legal-means-to-elevate-your-youtube-popularity-by-one-million/"><u>[Updated] 2024 Approved Legal Means to Elevate Your YouTube Popularity by One Million</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-links.techidaily.com/updated-2024-approved-streamselect-an-alternative-to-dacast/"><u>[Updated] 2024 Approved StreamSelect An Alternative to DaCast</u></a></li><li><a href="https://on-screen-recording.techidaily.com/updated-in-2024-experts-handbook-elevating-screencasting-proficiency-using-mobizen-technology/"><u>[Updated] In 2024, Expert's Handbook Elevating Screencasting Proficiency Using Mobizen Technology</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-tips.techidaily.com/ed-unlocking-content-potential-through-youtube-aspect-ratios/"><u>[Updated] Unlocking Content Potential Through YouTube Aspect Ratios</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-support.techidaily.com/2024-approved-prime-picks-for-live-tv-access-and-streaming/"><u>2024 Approved Prime Picks for Live TV Access and Streaming</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-tips.techidaily.com/6-excellent-apps-to-capture-and-save-linkedin-videos-successfully-for-2024/"><u>6 Excellent Apps to Capture and Save LinkedIn Videos Successfully for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://mondly-stories.techidaily.com/how-many-languages-does-santa-fluent-in/"><u>How Many Languages Does Santa Fluent In?</u></a></li><li><a href="https://iphone-unlock.techidaily.com/how-to-change-country-on-app-store-for-iphone-6-with-7-methods-drfone-by-drfone-ios/"><u>How To Change Country on App Store for iPhone 6 With 7 Methods | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-tips.techidaily.com/e-tutorial-adding-youtube-playlists-to-your-site/"><u>Online Tutorial Adding YouTube Playlists to Your Site</u></a></li></ul></div>]]></content>

Cards are more graphical whereas annotations are text based. The cards slide in once you click the small “i” button on the video where as the annotation is there based on the timings set by the user. Moreover the main differences between the two are:</p><p>1. YouTube Cards are small and unobtrusive, unless a viewer chooses to click on them, which is why they are the better option when you are trying to get views on other videos. Irritating a few people with a big annotation might be worth it if you also draw other people’s attention to your cause or website, but it is not a good way to endear yourself to people you are trying to get views and subscriptions from. When a card is clicked a thumbnail will appear with a link to your additional content. YouTube Cards are often better than annotations for adding links to your videos because they look much tidier. Also, unlike annotations, cards will be visible to people watching your videos on their mobile devices.</p><p>2. You cannot use Cards just to insert notes into your videos, though, and you cannot adjust their size like you can with annotations. So, if you do need a link to be large and extremely noticeable, annotations might still be your best option. Cards and annotations can even be used in combination sometimes.</p><ul><li><a href="#part1">Part 1: How to Add YouTube Cards</a></li><li><a href="#part2">Part 2: How to Add YouTube Annotations</a></li></ul><blockquote><p> Disclaimer: This post includes affiliate links</p><p> If you click on a link and make a purchase, I may receive a commission at no extra cost to you.</p></blockquote><h2 id="How-to-add-YouTube-Cards"><a href="#How-to-add-YouTube-Cards" class="headerlink" title="How to add YouTube Cards"></a>How to add YouTube Cards</h2><p>YouTube <strong>Cards</strong> are similar to annotations but more interactive.

Speech Bubbles"></a>1. Speech Bubbles</h4><p>Speech Bubbles: look like the dialogue box in a comic strip. There is a tail which you can adjust so it looks like one of the people in your video is saying what is written in the annotation. Speech bubbles are great for adding in funny comments.</p><h4 id="2-Notes"><a href="#2-Notes" class="headerlink" title="2. Notes"></a>2. Notes</h4><p>Notes: come in a limited selection of colors and can be adjusted to take up a maximum of 30% of your player screen. Sometimes you need a huge annotation to get an important point across, but using huge note annotations too often – especially near the beginnings of your videos – will annoy viewers. If you need a large note annotation make sure to place it later in your video, when a viewer will already be invested in what they are watching and less likely to click away.</p><h4 id="3-Titles"><a href="#3-Titles" class="headerlink" title="3. Titles"></a>3. Titles</h4><p>Titles: are large pieces of text that go either at the beginning of your video or in-between different topics within your video. YouTube’s titles are not very nice to look at, but they are a decent option if you do not have access to video editing software.</p><h4 id="4-Spotlights"><a href="#4-Spotlights" class="headerlink" title="4. Spotlights"></a>4. Spotlights</h4><p>Spotlights: have a subtle border and are completely clear inside. Your text only appears when a user hovers over the spotlight. Spotlights are great for turning elements within your video into links.</p><h4 id="5-Labels"><a href="#5-Labels" class="headerlink" title="5. Labels"></a>5. Labels</h4><p>Labels: are completely transparent, like spotlights, but the user does not have to hover over them for your text to be visible.</p><h4 id="6-Pauses"><a href="#6-Pauses" class="headerlink" title="6. Pauses"></a>6. Pauses</h4><p>Pauses: are no longer available to add to your videos, although Pause Annotations added before they were removed still work. Pause Annotations used to stop your video for a set period of time when your annotation appeared.</p><p>If somebody watches your video and gets to the end then that means they enjoyed it and will probably be open to checking out more of your content. Rather than hoping that your other videos show up in the ‘Suggested Videos’ YouTube will show after yours has finished playing you should always include an outro, or ending card, after your video to recommend your own work. Annotations are used in a lot of successful YouTuber’s ending cards.</p><p>One form this takes is small Note annotations in the bottom corners of the screen, one linking to your previous video and one to the next. Sometimes your viewers might not necessarily get the most enjoyment out of your videos by watching them in order, though. Sometimes you want to link viewers to the videos that are most related to the one they just watched.</p><p>The best outros also include a subscribe button, which can be created using annotations. These annotations work best when combined with a verbal call to action. Make sure your outro lasts long enough for people to make the decision to subscribe or click another video.</p><p>No matter what kind of annotations you are using, you should never use more than two of them at a time anywhere except for your outro. You should also never place annotations at the very top of your screen, or in the middle at the bottom. If your video is embedding on a separate website then the player will cover annotations at the top of the screen, and ads might cover annotations placed in the bottom-middle of the screen. Keep in mind when using annotations that they will not be visible to users watching your videos on mobile devices. If mobile traffic is very important to you then consider using YouTube Cards.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/richard-bennett.jpg"                      alt="author avatar"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/1886069/19272" target="_top" id="1886069">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-1886069" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="300" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/1886069/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p>Richard Bennett</p><p>Richard Bennett is a writer and a lover of all things video.</p><p>Follow @Richard Bennett</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://youtube-tips.techidaily.com/raft-an-attractive-animation-from-any-video-a-comprehensive-youtube-to-gif-guide-for-2024/"><u>[New] Craft an Attractive Animation From Any Video - A Comprehensive Youtube-to-GIF Guide for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-tips.techidaily.com/n-2024-the-investors-guide-to-choosing-yt-channels/"><u>[New] In 2024, The Investor's Guide to Choosing YT Channels</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-tips.techidaily.com/ed-15-essential-gaming-capture-programs-for-2024/"><u>[Updated] 15 Essential Gaming Capture Programs for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://screen-mirroring-recording.techidaily.com/updated-in-2024-unlocking-audio-potential-in-audacity-mac-edition/"><u>[Updated] In 2024, Unlocking Audio Potential in Audacity, Mac Edition</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-tips.techidaily.com/ed-the-no-ads-creators-course-earnings-strategies-for-self-sustained-success-for-2024/"><u>[Updated] The No-Ads Creator’s Course Earnings Strategies for Self-Sustained Success for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-tips.techidaily.com/ed-the-pathway-to-lyrical-masterpieces-via-lyric-video-maker-software-for-2024/"><u>[Updated] The Pathway to Lyrical Masterpieces via Lyric Video Maker Software for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-tips.techidaily.com/ed-unlocking-high-impact-content-masterful-strategies-for-more-views/"><u>[Updated] Unlocking High-Impact Content Masterful Strategies for More Views</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-tips.techidaily.com/ed-voice-of-volume-6-free-apps-for-channeling-youtube-music-onto-android-devices-for-2024/"><u>[Updated] Voice of Volume 6 Free Apps for Channeling YouTube Music Onto Android Devices for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-stream.techidaily.com/2024-approved-professional-content-creation-tools-review-studio-vs-beta/"><u>2024 Approved Professional Content Creation Tools Review Studio Vs.

However, the list had changed after 2020 due to the rise of a catchy kid song - Baby Shark Dance. This child song video has reached more than 9 billion views worldwide (still growing) and led to an online dancing fever - Body Shark Challenge.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://united.elfm.net/c/5597632/2139558/4704" target="_top" id="2139558">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/4704-2139558" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="160" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://united.elfm.net/i/5597632/2139558/4704"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Top-10-Most-Watched-YouTube-Videos-in-2021"><a href="#Top-10-Most-Watched-YouTube-Videos-in-2021" class="headerlink" title="Top 10 Most Watched YouTube Videos in 2021"></a>Top 10 Most Watched YouTube Videos in 2021</h2><p>You may have expected this, but the majority of the most popular YouTube videos are actually music videos. Most, but not all. Here’s our list based on the latest statistics about the most viewed youtube video ever available right now. If you want to know more about the channels or the YouTubers, you can use <a class="link"   href="https://www.influenex.com/" >InflueNex <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> to get the details of them.</p><p>Here is a full list of the most viewed videos on YouTube except for Body Shark Dance.</p><ul><li><a href="#part1">Despacito - Luis Fonsi ft.

Despacito - Luis Fonsi ft. Daddy Yankee"></a>1. Despacito - Luis Fonsi ft. Daddy Yankee</h4><p> <strong>Views:5.4B</strong></p><p>Despacito, the Spanish word for ‘slowly’, has broken all records in terms of the most viewed YouTube videos, reaching the milestone of two billion views faster than any other video, ever. It went on to reach 2.5 billion views faster than any other and now boasts more than five billion views, making it the most-watched YouTube video of all time.</p><p>As a song that’s almost completely sung in Spanish, the immense popularity of this video surprised everyone. Although hugely popular in Hispanic countries, Despacito was also top of the charts in 45 different countries, from Uruguay to Japan to Italy, so what made it so popular? Experts have speculated that its mix of Caribbean, Latin, pop, and rap gave it a broad appeal. Its earwormish nature, danceable beat, and perfectly summery vibe have propelled this fairly mediocre video to the heights of YouTube stardom that the rest of us can only dream about.</p><h4 id="2-See-You-Again-Wiz-Khalifa-ft-Charlie-Puth"><a href="#2-See-You-Again-Wiz-Khalifa-ft-Charlie-Puth" class="headerlink" title="2. See You Again - Wiz Khalifa ft. Charlie Puth"></a>2. See You Again - Wiz Khalifa ft. Charlie Puth</h4><p> <strong>Views:3.7B</strong></p><p>See You Again is a pretty cool song but is it really cool enough to be number two of the most-watched YouTube videos? Sure, the tune is catchy, and the video production is probably better than that of Despacito, but its rapid rise to YouTube stardom was still rather unexpected. Over 800 days after release, the video had clocked up almost three billion views, unseating the reigning champion of YouTube views, Psy and his K-Pop masterpiece, Gangnam Style, and today it’s sitting comfortably in the number two spot with 3.6 billion watches.</p><p>So, why did this tune go so viral? Was it the loyal Fast and the Furious fan base craving more time with the <em>Furious 7</em> soundtrack, or was it the tributary nature of the video paying homage to the late Paul Walker that was bringing in the views? In truth, it was probably both and also neither. The main influencer here was simply that a lot more people were using YouTube. Between 2015 and 2016, YouTube experienced a 17 percent increase in music video viewers and a total 25 percent increase in video streams. See You Again was simply in the right place at the right time.</p><h4 id="3-Shape-of-You-Ed-Sheeran"><a href="#3-Shape-of-You-Ed-Sheeran" class="headerlink" title="3. Shape of You - Ed Sheeran"></a>3. Shape of You - Ed Sheeran</h4><p> <strong>Views:3.7B</strong></p><p>If there’s one artist who has rocked the music scene more than any other in recent years, Mr. Sheeran is it. His double lead single from his latest album ÷ (divide) has been his most successful to date, racking up 3.5 billion views on YouTube to date with millions more added each day. It is Spotify’s most popular song ever with 1.5 billion streams and currently holds the record for the most number of weeks spent in the Billboard top 10. It’s was nominated for best single at the Brit Awards 2021 but was pipped at the post by Rag’n’Bone Man with Human.</p><p>But why does everyone love Shape of You so much? It’s a pretty simple song, with four basic chords and fairly boring romantic lyrics; what makes it so special? Some of its success is down to the physical construction of the music itself, with a pentatonic scale offering a tried and tested catchiness that’s impossible to resist. Even if you’re not a Sheeran fan, exposure has made this song familiar to you, being popular in clubs, pubs, restaurants and with buskers on street corners (not to mention certain Christmas adverts, right?). Add to all this the rise in general popularity of music videos, it’s clear to see how it’s become one of the most viewed YouTube videos of all time.</p><h4 id="4-Gangnam-Style-Psy"><a href="#4-Gangnam-Style-Psy" class="headerlink" title="4. Gangnam Style - Psy"></a>4. Gangnam Style - Psy</h4><p> <strong>Views:3.2B</strong></p><p>We’d be surprised if you could honestly say you’d never heard of Gangnam Style (and perhaps secretly tried a few horse dance moves), and Psy himself was undoubtedly pretty surprised too when he rocketed to internet fame in 2013. At its peak, this K-Pop legend was racking up 72 views per second and averaged 33 views a second for two whole years. Today, he’s fourth on the list with a total of 3.2 billion views (and yes, people are still watching).</p><p>Although it might seem Psy was inherently lucky when his song became such a huge hit, actually what he did was very clever. As well as combining a catchy tune with a ridiculously funny video, he intentionally left copyright off the video itself, almost inviting others to create their own parodies of the video, which they did in their droves. The dance he created was nothing short of genius, easily replicable by others all over the world. Despite being ‘K-Pop’, Psy’s own look is a world away from the polished pretty boy image of other artists in this genre, offering more of an anti-pop image from a guy who is clearly comfortable in his own skin. The result is the full package of measures, and deservedly places Gangnam Style in the top 10 most-watched YouTube videos of all time.</p><h4 id="5-Masha-and-the-Bear-Recipe-for-Disaster-Get-Movies"><a href="#5-Masha-and-the-Bear-Recipe-for-Disaster-Get-Movies" class="headerlink" title="5. Masha and the Bear: Recipe for Disaster - Get Movies"></a>5. Masha and the Bear: Recipe for Disaster - Get Movies</h4><p> <strong>Views:3.2B</strong></p><p>A rather unusual entry for our number five slot, Masha and the Bear, as you might have guessed, is not a music video at all. It’s not even an official video, and to top it off it’s in Russian! Masha and the Bear is incredibly popular in Russia and is based loosely on an old Russian folk story, and since all 68 episodes have been uploaded to YouTube, three have surpassed the one billion view mark.</p><p>This particular episode is the crowning glory, having racked up 3.1 billion views over the years. The reason for this particular episode’s incredibly popularity is not entirely clear, although it is thought that perhaps the way Masha herself is portrayed has helped its success. Dressed in a folk costume with no legs on show and a headscarf makes the video acceptable to Muslim audiences around the world, which may have helped to spread its popularity.</p><h4 id="6-Uptown-Funk-Mark-Ronson-ft-Bruno-Mars"><a href="#6-Uptown-Funk-Mark-Ronson-ft-Bruno-Mars" class="headerlink" title="6. Uptown Funk - Mark Ronson ft. Bruno Mars"></a>6. Uptown Funk - Mark Ronson ft. Bruno Mars</h4><p> <strong>Views:3.2B</strong></p><p>Also with 3.1 billion views, the inimitably catchy Uptown Funk by Mark Ronson has been his biggest hit to date. Boasting chart-topping success in the US, Australia, New Zealand, Canada, and many other locations around the world, the single won two Grammys, record of the year, and spent 14 weeks at number one in the US. So, what was it that got people watching, singing, and dancing along with Ronson and Mars?</p><p>Part of the success is undoubtedly down to the amazing lyrics of the song. From repeating how hot he is to namechecking Michelle Pfeiffer and Saint Laurent, these are feel-good power lyrics at their very best. The simple four-chord structure and effortlessly funky beat help its appeal bridge the generations, and the video itself just screams fun, fun, fun! Don’t believe us, just watch (the YouTube video, of course)!</p><h4 id="7-Sorry-Justin-Bieber"><a href="#7-Sorry-Justin-Bieber" class="headerlink" title="7. Sorry - Justin Bieber"></a>7. Sorry - Justin Bieber</h4><p> <strong>Views:3 B</strong></p><p>It’s no surprise that the young person’s sensation that is Justin Bieber had to make an appearance in our top 10 most-watched YouTube videos. He is, after all, the epitome of the YouTube generation, and has plenty of other well-watched videos in his archives. Selling 10 million copies in 2016 alone and topping the charts in 13 countries, Sorry has racked up, to date, 2.9 billion hits on YouTube, making it his most successful music video ever. So, what was the secret to this hit’s success?</p><p>Actually, we think that the reason for the success of this particular Bieber creation is due in part to the mismatch between the visuals and the audio. A languishing video requesting redemption from a lover would typically be shot in gritty black and white and feature the singer moping about feeling sorry for themselves. Instead, Bieber opted to recruit lively dancers from New Zealand’s ReQuest Dance Crew and furnish them with eye-popping outfits and lively dance moves to make up for the potentially depressing lyrics.</p><h4 id="8-Sugar-Maroon-5"><a href="#8-Sugar-Maroon-5" class="headerlink" title="8. Sugar - Maroon 5"></a>8. Sugar - Maroon 5</h4><p> <strong>Views:2.7B</strong></p><p>Maroon 5 had enjoyed a somewhat tumultuous career, achieving fame in the noughties, disappearing for a while, and then returning with outstanding hits such as ‘moves like Jagger’ and ‘One more night’. But this song, Sugar, has been their biggest video hit to date. Why? Well, the proof is in the pudding as they say.</p><p>This was a completely new concept video, shot in a variety of locations around Los Angeles and featuring Maroon 5 crashing numerous weddings. The reality is that the band did arrange things somewhat with the groom, although the bride and her guests had no idea. The resulting video is a joy to watch, as the assembled wedding parties express their shock, surprise, fear, and even anger as Levine and his crew pitch up and start singing.</p><p>Looking for the best wedding video songs?

Shake It Off - Taylor Swift"></a>9. Shake It Off - Taylor Swift</h4><p> <strong>Views:2.6B</strong></p><p>After a long drought of almost a year, devoted fans of Taylor Swift were sick to death of hearing ‘I Knew you were Trouble’ on the radio five hundred times a day, so Shake it Off was almost guaranteed to be a big hit. Going straight into number one on the charts and staying in the Hot 100 for 50 consecutive weeks, its success on YouTube was even greater, boasting 2.5 billion views to date and making it the 9th most-watched video on YouTube. But how?</p><p>Swift is a master of generating internet attention. With over 100 million Instagram followers, Taylor set about whipping her ‘Little Monsters’ into a frenzy about the forthcoming release of her new single. As a result, Shake it Off was pretty much all the internet cared about for a full 24 hours. The lyrics tread a thin line between playful mockery of Swift and self-aware empowerment but are also super easy to memories and sing along with. Well played madam, well played.</p><h4 id="10-Roar-Katy-Perry"><a href="#10-Roar-Katy-Perry" class="headerlink" title="10. Roar - Katy Perry"></a>10. Roar - Katy Perry</h4><p> <strong>Views:2.6B</strong></p><p>In 2013, Katy Perry took a short break out of kissing girls and liking it, as well as marrying (and divorcing) Russell Brand in order to release this banging new single. By the end of the year, Roar had sold almost 10 million copies and had topped the charts in 12 different countries. Its success on the radio was only surpassed by the success of the colorful music video on YouTube, where it has secured 2.5 billion views to date.</p><p>What’s not to love about this particular video, we ask? The lyrics are super empowering, you can run to it, dance to it, or just belt out your own roar alongside Katy. The visuals are awesome too, in particular the CGI animals and skimpy leopard print bikini, which undoubtedly helped its popularity. In a year that was tough personally for Perry, she hit back and produced this powerful song, showing once again that she is indeed a champion.</p><p> <strong>Conclusion</strong></p><p>All the videos listed above have billions of views after it is on YouTube, however, Rome wasn’t built in a day.

With this <strong>YouTube’s speed control</strong>, 1 is the normal speed, with 0.25 being one-quarter (1&#x2F;4th) of the actual speed and slowing the video. In the same vein, 2x is twice the average speed, increasing the video speed.</p><p>However, in as much as <strong>YouTube speed control</strong> slows or speeds up the video, it does not change the pitch of the video. All it does is either expand or compress the video samples while still maintaining the video or audio pitch. It would still sound like the podcaster or video blogger is just talking faster or slower.</p><p>Music would still maintain the same musical key and pitch while playing faster or slower.</p><p>If you are watching a presentation or interview that seems like everyone is talking like they have all the time in the world, you can <strong>fast forward YouTube</strong> video by using the feature.</p><p>Also, you can slow down a tutorial or the video you are watching if you feel they are too fast using this <strong>YouTube speed control</strong>.</p><p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p><p><strong>YouTube speed control</strong> has made it easier to change <strong>YouTube playback speed</strong> to either speed up or slow down the video. This enables you to capture important moments or information you may miss if the video was fast. Also, you can save time and get to the information you are searching for as soon as possible by speeding the YouTube video.</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://some-techniques.techidaily.com/new-guide-to-exporting-pinterest-videos-into-mp3-format/"><u>[New] Guide to Exporting Pinterest Videos Into MP3 Format</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-tips.techidaily.com/ed-2024-approved-streamlining-youtube-videos-adding-subtitles-and-cc-proficiently/"><u>[Updated] 2024 Approved Streamlining YouTube Videos Adding Subtitles & CC Proficiently</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook-video-share.techidaily.com/updated-in-2024-5-essential-tips-for-monetizing-your-content-finding-the-right-viewer-count/"><u>[Updated] In 2024, 5 Essential Tips for Monetizing Your Content Finding the Right Viewer Count</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-tips.techidaily.com/ed-unleashing-potential-crafting-a-youtube-channel-brand-for-success-for-2024/"><u>[Updated] Unleashing Potential Crafting a YouTube Channel Brand for Success for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-tips.techidaily.com/approved-smartphone-camera-accessories-vloggers-should-try-to-improve-recording/"><u>2024 Approved Smartphone Camera Accessories Vloggers Should Try to Improve Recording</u></a></li><li><a href="https://screen-video-capture.techidaily.com/best-10-web-based-hd-screen-capture-tools-for-2024/"><u>Best 10 Web-Based HD Screen Capture Tools for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-friendly.techidaily.com/free-videography-starter-pack-openers-and-more-for-2024/"><u>Free Videography Starter Pack Openers & More for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-approaches.techidaily.com/in-2024-premier-podplay-writing-treasures/"><u>In 2024, Premier Podplay Writing Treasures</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-tips.techidaily.com/24-the-animators-odyssey-crafting-your-own-fx-realm/"><u>In 2024, The Animator's Odyssey Crafting Your Own FX Realm</u></a></li><li><a href="https://digital-screen-recording.techidaily.com/ishowu-audio-capture-review-for-2024/"><u>IShowU Audio Capture Review for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-help.techidaily.com/launching-educator-channels-10-key-tips-for-youtube-success-for-2024/"><u>Launching Educator Channels 10 Key Tips for YouTube Success for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://tech-revival.techidaily.com/navigating-multilingual-conversations-tips-for-leveraging-chatgpts-language-abilities/"><u>Navigating Multilingual Conversations: Tips for Leveraging ChatGPT's Language Abilities</u></a></li></ul></div>]]></content>

There is a very large collection of art you could repurpose for your channel art, but some creators on the site have also created graphics specifically to be used as YouTube banners.</p><p>Here are some channel art galleries on Behance: <a class="link"   href="https://www.behance.net/gallery/10819163/Youtube-Background-Art" >Ej &#x2F; Vritra <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, <a class="link"   href="https://www.behance.net/gallery/11697655/Youtube-Channel-Art" >Austin Evans <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>You can download PSD files from Behance and edit them in Photoshop. There isn’t a PNG or JPG option for people who don’t have Photoshop, though.</p><p>In order to download the templates you’ll need to hover your cursor over the Photoshop icon, and then click ‘Download Now’ when it appears. You’ll need to make an account before you can download.</p><h4 id="3-YourTube"><a href="#3-YourTube" class="headerlink" title="3. YourTube"></a>3. <a class="link"   href="http://yourtubetheme.com/youtube-channel-art-templates/" >YourTube <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h4><p>With over 500 templates available, YourTube has the largest selection on this list. They have every style you can think of, from minimalist to video game themed.</p><p>The site is run by two web designers who make the money they need to maintain the site from the few premium&#x2F;paid options available (although the vast majority of templates are free).</p><p>Most of the templates are JPG backgrounds which you will need to add your own text to.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://ephamedtechinc.pxf.io/c/5597632/2130528/26400" target="_top" id="2130528">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/26400-2130528" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://ephamedtechinc.pxf.io/i/5597632/2130528/26400"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Part-2-9-Banner-Makers-with-Free-Templates"><a href="#Part-2-9-Banner-Makers-with-Free-Templates" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: 9 Banner Makers with Free Templates"></a>Part 2: 9 Banner Makers with Free Templates</h2><p>In this section you’ll find 9 YouTube channel art makers.</p><h4 id="1-Wondershare-PixStudio"><a href="#1-Wondershare-PixStudio" class="headerlink" title="1. Wondershare PixStudio"></a>1. <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/fotophire/download/" >Wondershare PixStudio <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h4><p>Wondershare PixStudio has special features to remove the image background. With a single click, you can quickly remove the image background, and use your image with more flexibility. Just payment of $7.99 per month to use the features.</p><h4 id="2-Adobe-Spark"><a href="#2-Adobe-Spark" class="headerlink" title="2. Adobe Spark"></a>2. <a class="link"   href="https://spark.adobe.com/make/youtube-channel-art-maker" >Adobe Spark <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h4><p>To edit the templates available through Adobe Spark, just click on the resources in the template and then click on the images&#x2F;fonts&#x2F;etc you want to substitute in. Resources like filters are also very accessible.</p><p>Everything you do in Spark starts with clicking on an element in the template. You won’t see all of the menus at once, just the ones related to the element you’ve selected (i.e. the background image or the text).</p><p>The only downside of Spark is that free downloads include a watermark. The silver lining is that that watermark is small and located in the bottom-right corner, meaning that it won’t show up for viewers watching your channel on either computers or mobile devices.</p><p><em><strong>Note:</strong> for some reason when you click ‘Create your YouTube channel art’ it will load a thumbnail template instead of a banner template. Click Resize in the side menu to switch to channel art or your exported image won’t be big enough.</em></p><h4 id="3-BeFunky"><a href="#3-BeFunky" class="headerlink" title="3. BeFunky"></a>3. <a class="link"   href="https://www.befunky.com/" >BeFunky <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h4><p>This is a graphics creator that doubles as a banner maker. You’ll need to enter BeFunky’s ‘Designer’ tool in order to find the channel art templates under ‘Social Media Headers’ and ‘YouTube’. There’s actually only 1 free channel art template, but it is a very standard channel art layout which you can customize with your own images.</p><h4 id="4-Canva"><a href="#4-Canva" class="headerlink" title="4. Canva"></a>4. <a class="link"   href="https://www.canva.com/" >Canva <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h4><p>Canva is one of the most popular free channel art makers. It is an easy to use, drag and drop, program that will automatically resize images to work in the spaces you drag them to. It has great free resources like stock photos. Some resources are paid ($1), but many are free.</p><p>The templates on Canva do tend to include paid resources, but it’s easy enough to swap them out with free resources or your own images.</p><h4 id="5-Crello"><a href="#5-Crello" class="headerlink" title="5. Crello"></a>5. <a class="link"   href="https://blog.crello.com/a-collection-of-free-youtube-channel-art-templates/" >Crello <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h4><p>Crello offers 10 examples free channel art templates through their blog, and you can even edit the templates right on the site.</p><p>Crello is an easy to use visual editor created for social media and marketing, meaning that it was made to be easy for non-designers to jump into. Beyond the free templates and text options, however, most of their stock photos and backgrounds cost $1. To use Crello for free you either need to use the default images, or upload your own.</p><h4 id="6-Design-Wizard"><a href="#6-Design-Wizard" class="headerlink" title="6. Design Wizard"></a>6. <a class="link"   href="https://www.designwizard.com/" >Design Wizard <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h4><p>This is another program with a small number of free templates that you can make almost anything out of through customization. One of the most useful features of design wizard is that it will show you the ‘safe zone’ – the area of your banner that will show up on any device screen – so you can design with that in mind.</p><p>Remember to delete the safe zone marker before you export.</p><h4 id="7-Fotor"><a href="#7-Fotor" class="headerlink" title="7. Fotor"></a>7. <a class="link"   href="https://www.fotor.com/features/youtube.html" >Fotor <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h4><p>Another graphics program with free templates for YouTube channel art. Fotor is easy to use – perhaps the easiest program on this list to use. In the ‘background’ tab you don’t even have to drag and drop, you just click on the element in your template and then click on what you want to replace it with. You can even load in your own images.</p><p>There are paid options in Fotor which will add a watermark to your design unless you upgrade to their paid service, but there are enough free options to satisfy most creators.</p><h4 id="8-Snappa"><a href="#8-Snappa" class="headerlink" title="8. Snappa"></a>8. <a class="link"   href="https://snappa.com/create/youtube-channel-art" >Snappa <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h4><p>If you want to get something made fast, Snappa can do that. Just find YouTube Channel Art under Headers and choose one of the free templates (there are a lot). Then it’s just a matter of swapping out the elements in the template with ones that suit your channel and clicking download.</p><p>Snappa shows you the safe areas for different devices while you edit.</p><h4 id="9-Visme"><a href="#9-Visme" class="headerlink" title="9. Visme"></a>9. <a class="link"   href="http://blog.visme.co/youtube-banner-template/" >Visme <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h4><p>Visme provides 50 free channel art templates you can edit through their online graphics service. The banner maker is a big more complicated than some of the other makers on this list (it has a lot of options that are more for marketers than YouTubers, which weighs it down a bit), but the free templates are great and you can upload your own images to use with them.</p><p>How did you make your banner? Did you use a channel art template?</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/richard-bennett.jpg"                      alt="author avatar"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2130887/7443" target="_top" id="2130887">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2130887" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2130887/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p>Richard Bennett</p><p>Richard Bennett is a writer and a lover of all things video.</p><p>Follow @Richard Bennett</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://youtube-tips.techidaily.com/n-2024-is-screening-youtube-footage-illegal/"><u>[New] In 2024, Is Screening YouTube Footage Illegal?</u></a></li><li><a href="https://desktop-recording.techidaily.com/new-in-depth-look-at-high-quality-minecraft-recordings/"><u>[New] In-Depth Look at High-Quality Minecraft Recordings</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-tips.techidaily.com/he-breakdown-of-youtubes-shorts-initiative/"><u>[New] The Breakdown of YouTube's Shorts Initiative</u></a></li><li><a href="https://instagram-video-recordings.techidaily.com/new-transform-your-photos-into-musical-masterpieces-withwithout/"><u>[New] Transform Your Photos Into Musical Masterpieces (With/Without)</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook-videos.techidaily.com/new-wechat-photo-frame-specifications/"><u>[New] WeChat Photo Frame Specifications</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-tips.techidaily.com/ed-2024-approved-expert-tips-for-harnessing-the-power-of-top-9-free-youtube-makers/"><u>[Updated] 2024 Approved Expert Tips for Harnessing the Power of Top 9 Free YouTube Makers</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-tips.techidaily.com/ed-in-2024-maximizing-video-impact-fairly-and-effectively/"><u>[Updated] In 2024, Maximizing Video Impact Fairly and Effectively</u></a></li><li><a href="https://screen-recording.techidaily.com/updated-in-2024-the-ultimate-approach-to-preserving-your-ps4-experience/"><u>[Updated] In 2024, The Ultimate Approach to Preserving Your PS4 Experience</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-tips.techidaily.com/ed-tailored-sound-rate-on-youtube-desktopmobile-for-2024/"><u>[Updated] Tailored Sound Rate on YouTube (Desktop/Mobile) for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-tips.techidaily.com/ed-the-hidden-value-in-uninterrupted-youtube-watching-is-it-worth-the-investment-for-2024/"><u>[Updated] The Hidden Value in Uninterrupted YouTube Watching Is It Worth the Investment for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://win-bytes.techidaily.com/oggwav-movavi/"><u>线上即时将OGG文件转换成高清晰度WAV - 用户友好界面Movavi转换器</u></a></li><li><a href="https://phone-solutions.techidaily.com/all-about-factory-reset-what-is-it-and-what-it-does-to-your-lava-blaze-2-drfone-by-drfone-reset-android-reset-android/"><u>All About Factory Reset, What Is It and What It Does to Your Lava Blaze 2? | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-tips.techidaily.com/ing-the-perfect-aesthetic-with-controlled-lighting-for-2024/"><u>Crafting the Perfect Aesthetic with Controlled Lighting for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-tips.techidaily.com/24-boosting-your-channels-income-the-optimal-view-count-quotient/"><u>In 2024, Boosting Your Channel's Income The Optimal View Count Quotient</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-help.techidaily.com/logitech-c615-webcam-overview-evaluating-its-performance-for-every-budget-shopper/"><u>Logitech C615 Webcam Overview: Evaluating Its Performance for Every Budget Shopper</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-that.techidaily.com/safari-lags-on-ios-discover-these-4-strategies-for-swift-browsing/"><u>Safari Lags on iOS?

That’s pretty common.</p><p>If you have a DSLR then you can set it down on any stable surface while filming yourself, but your phone can’t stand up by itself. It needs something or someone to hold it. Do you just accept that and shoot everything as a selfie?</p><p>No. No, you don’t, because there are common household items that can help you out of this problem. For this DIY tripod, you need either <strong>2 binder clips</strong> or <strong>2 ‘claw clips’</strong> (also called ‘hair jaws’).</p><p>Hold your phone in landscape mode (horizontally, so it’s long rather than tall) and attach clips to the bottom corners. If you are worried about scratching your screen, fold up some paper to place between your clip and your phone.</p><p>Here it is with binder clips:</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/binder-clips.jpg"                      alt="binder clips"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2137412/7443" target="_top" id="2137412">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2137412" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2137412/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p>And here it is with hair clips:</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/hair-clips.jpg"                      alt="hair clips"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aidotcom.pxf.io/c/5597632/2134499/19576" target="_top" id="2134499">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19576-2134499" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="600" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aidotcom.pxf.io/i/5597632/2134499/19576"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p>Now you can set your smartphone upon any stable surface, like a table or a stack of books.</p><p> <em>Here are some more cool ideas!</em></p><h3 id="DIY-adjustable-tripod-using-books-and-a-towel"><a href="#DIY-adjustable-tripod-using-books-and-a-towel" class="headerlink" title="DIY adjustable tripod using books and a towel"></a><strong>DIY adjustable tripod using books and a towel</strong></h3><p>You’ve probably heard a million times that you can stabilize your camera by sitting it down on any stable surface – on your desk, on a stack of books, up in a tree, etc. This is very true!</p><p>But if you can use any stable surface, why do people buy tripods?</p><p>Because it isn’t convenient to rearrange your furniture whenever you want to make a video, and also because tripods are adjustable. You can change their height, you can use them to pan or tilt, and it’s pretty easy to move them a bit forwards or backward while you’re setting up your shot.</p><p>To get similar functions from the ‘any stable surface’ solution you can use a <strong>table</strong>, a <strong>stack of books</strong>, and a <strong>towel</strong>.</p><ol><li>Set up the area where you’re going to sit while you’re filming on one end of the table.</li><li>Put the towel down over the approximate spot you want your camera to be.</li><li>Stack your books on top of the towel.</li><li>Put your camera on top of the books.</li></ol><p>Now if your camera isn’t up high enough, or is too high, you can adjust it just by adding or taking away books. If you want to move it closer or farther away from you, just pull the towel forwards or backward.</p><h3 id="DIY-gripping-‘Gorillapod’-using-wire-and-tape"><a href="#DIY-gripping-‘Gorillapod’-using-wire-and-tape" class="headerlink" title="DIY gripping ‘Gorillapod’ using wire and tape"></a><strong>DIY gripping ‘Gorillapod’ using wire and tape</strong></h3><p>Gorillapod’s are cool because you can use them like normal tripods, carry them around like selfie sticks, or attach them to things like fences and posts. Here’s how you can make something similar using <strong>wire</strong>, <strong>electrical tape</strong> or <strong>duct tape</strong>, and a <strong>1&#x2F;4 bolt</strong>.</p><p>Your wire should be fairly stiff and you’ll need three pieces the same length, which should be at least 10 inches. Old clothes hangers work well. This needs to be something strong enough to support the weight of your camera, but soft enough that it’s not impossible for you to bend.</p><p> <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/wire-and-type.jpg"                      alt="wire and type"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2144308/7443" target="_top" id="2144308">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2144308" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="600" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2144308/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p><em>All of your supplies plus the finished product.</em></p><p><strong>Readying your legs</strong></p><p><strong><em>Step 1:</em></strong> Bend 2 inches at one end of each wire into a ‘U’ shape. You will probably need pliers for this.</p><p><strong><em>Step 2:</em></strong> Pick up one of your pieces of wire and wrap one end with electrical tape. Go around 5-10 times (to prevent it from coming undone at the end) and then, without cutting your tape, start moving up and wrapping the rest of your wire. Stop before your ‘U’ section.</p><p>Repeat this with the other two wires.</p><p> <strong>Attaching your legs</strong></p><p><em><strong>Step 1:</strong></em> Place the ‘U’ section of a leg against your bolt. The bolt’s threading should be pointing away from the leg. Now, use your tape to attach them. Wind it around 2 or 3 times, then repeat the process with both of the other legs individually.</p><p><em><strong>Step 2:</strong></em> After all the legs are attached, wrap some more tape around all 3 as tightly as you can.</p><p> Your camera will mount onto the bolt! You’ll be able to use this as a normal table-top tripod or use the flexible legs to grab onto different things like a Gorillapod. <em>Read more at</em> <a href="http://www.instructables.com/id/Pocket-Tripod/"><em>Instructables</em>.</a></p><p><em>Note: make sure the bolt is a fit for your camera before you get too far into this process.</em></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/richard-bennett.jpg"                      alt="author avatar"                ></p><p>Richard Bennett</p><p>Richard Bennett is a writer and a lover of all things video.</p><p>Follow @Richard Bennett</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://youtube-tips.techidaily.com/n-2024-beauty-bliss-essential-tutorials-for-ultimate-style/"><u>[New] In 2024, Beauty Bliss Essential Tutorials for Ultimate Style</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-tips.techidaily.com/treamlining-your-freefire-youtube-experience/"><u>[New] Streamlining Your FreeFire YouTube Experience</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-tips.techidaily.com/ed-master-guide-to-youtube-community-expectations-for-2024/"><u>[Updated] Master Guide to YouTube Community Expectations for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-tips.techidaily.com/ed-tele-loop-triumph-youtube-videos-endlessly-enjoyable-on-tv-for-2024/"><u>[Updated] Tele-Loop Triumph YouTube Videos, Endlessly Enjoyable on Tv for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-glue.techidaily.com/updated-the-decades-most-ingenious-frames-and-organizers-24/"><u>[Updated] The Decade's Most Ingenious Frames & Organizers '24</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-tips.techidaily.com/ed-the-step-by-step-guide-to-youtube-gamers-broadcasting/"><u>[Updated] The Step-by-Step Guide to YouTube Gamers' Broadcasting</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-tips.techidaily.com/ed-the-ultimate-breakdown-of-12-youtubes-best-in-class-gaming-openings/"><u>[Updated] The Ultimate Breakdown of 12 YouTube's Best-in-Class Gaming Openings</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-tips.techidaily.com/approved-from-backyard-blogs-to-billion-sub-youtube-channel/"><u>2024 Approved From Backyard Blogs to Billion-Sub YouTube Channel</u></a></li><li><a href="https://phone-solutions.techidaily.com/3-best-tools-to-hard-reset-samsung-galaxy-s23-drfone-by-drfone-reset-android-reset-android/"><u>3 Best Tools to Hard Reset Samsung Galaxy S23 | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook-video-recording.techidaily.com/camclip-extractor-chatfocused-for-2024/"><u>CamClip Extractor, ChatFocused for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://techtrends.techidaily.com/capture-memories-flawlessly-unveiling-the-best-selfie-sticks-through-six-essential-tips/"><u>Capture Memories Flawlessly: Unveiling the Best Selfie Sticks Through Six Essential Tips</u></a></li><li><a href="https://games-able.techidaily.com/economical-choices-for-immersive-vr-experiences/"><u>Economical Choices for Immersive VR Experiences</u></a></li><li><a href="https://phone-solutions.techidaily.com/in-2024-prevent-cross-site-tracking-on-honor-100-and-browser-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/"><u>In 2024, Prevent Cross-Site Tracking on Honor 100 and Browser | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://discover-alternatives.techidaily.com/lead-capture-optimization-through-the-innovative-use-of-cookiebot/"><u>Lead Capture Optimization Through the Innovative Use of Cookiebot</u></a></li><li><a href="https://ai-video-editing.techidaily.com/updated-how-to-create-vintage-film-effect-1990s/"><u>Updated How to Create Vintage Film Effect 1990S</u></a></li></ul></div>]]></content>

Many businesses make use of YouTube ads to get their products to their customers and it’s really effective. However, you can make more organic traffic using YouTube video marketing. With a successful YouTube video marketing strategy, you can generate leads without any ad investments.</p><p>And in this guide, we will discuss some YouTube video marketing tips that will help you get more subscribers and build your brand outreach.</p><blockquote><p> Disclaimer: This post includes affiliate links</p><p> If you click on a link and make a purchase, I may receive a commission at no extra cost to you.</p></blockquote><h2 id="Tip-1-Create-A-Roadmap-Leading-To-Your-Main-Goal"><a href="#Tip-1-Create-A-Roadmap-Leading-To-Your-Main-Goal" class="headerlink" title="Tip #1: Create A Roadmap Leading To Your Main Goal"></a><strong>Tip #1: Create A Roadmap Leading To Your Main Goal</strong></h2><p>A roadmap is basically a level by level approach to your vision. Instead of just looking at the end plan, you are building your platform up through short attainable goals. There is immense power in setting short term goals. Some serious questions that you should ask yourself are:</p><p><strong><em>Step 1:</em></strong> Start with the question of why you need a YouTube channel in the first place! Decide on what your channel should be about and how the viewers are going to benefit from it.</p><p><strong><em>Step 2:</em></strong> The next step is to prepare a content plan. Here must decide the type of videos and how often it will be published on your channel.</p><p><strong><em>Step 3:</em></strong> What is your target in terms of subscribers and traffic conversion. Do you plan to take the audience to a separate landing or are you planning on making money solely from YouTube?</p><p>Planning out such specifics will help you build your platform gradually to the main goal.</p><h2 id="Tip-2-Do-tests-within-your-strategy"><a href="#Tip-2-Do-tests-within-your-strategy" class="headerlink" title="Tip #2: Do tests within your strategy"></a><strong>Tip #2: Do tests within your strategy</strong></h2><p>Understanding the audience preferences is paramount to the success of YouTube channels. There are some important tests that you can do to understand the genre that you are targeting.</p><h3 id="a-Test-video-duration"><a href="#a-Test-video-duration" class="headerlink" title="a. Test video duration"></a>a. Test video duration</h3><p>Nobody likes to see a 2 hour long YouTube video unless it’s super interesting. Thankfully, there have been <a class="link"   href="https://www.minimatters.com/youtube-best-video-length/" >studies <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> that have been conducted to measure the audience reaction to videos of different lengths.</p><p>By default, when you create a YouTube account, the maximum upload length is restricted to just 15 minutes. You can go past this limit by verifying your account on YouTube.</p><p>When you look at the most trending videos on YouTube, they generally fall within 10 minutes. The average video size on YouTube is 4.4 minutes .</p><p>For example, let us look at YouTube videos that explain the same concept, but with different video lengths and see if the audience engagement differs with the videos. we have ensured that both videos are from channels who have a similar subscriber count in order to eliminate disproportionality that arises from viewer base.</p><p>This video gives an excellent explanation of the string theory. The Video is From TED-Ed and you can see the audience response in the comments where they praise Physicist Brian Greene for his talk. Note that the video has 2.4 million views.</p><p>Now, look at the above video that explains String Theory in less than half the time from TED-Ed. Notice how the video has more than four times the views with an impressive 10 million views. It comes to show that if you can condense your content in such a way that you can get the maximum meaning across in minimum time, you will rack up more views!</p><h3 id="b-Test-different-formats-scenarios"><a href="#b-Test-different-formats-scenarios" class="headerlink" title="b. Test different formats&#x2F;scenarios"></a>b. Test different formats&#x2F;scenarios</h3><p>Having a monotonous nature throughout your videos can be quite tiring for the viewer after some time. Make sure to mix things up a bit by introducing new types of video formats or scenarios that keeps the users engaged.</p><p>Such a format change will also be invaluable in testing the audience reaction to the different types of videos that you make.

Also, for pro content, it offers features like “Motionmaker” to users and live streaming to creators.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/Dailymotion-Monetization-vs-YouTube-Which-Is-More-Profitable-3.jpg"                      alt="dailymotion: what is it"                ></p><h3 id="The-popularity-and-user-base-of-YouTube-and-Dailymotion-1"><a href="#The-popularity-and-user-base-of-YouTube-and-Dailymotion-1" class="headerlink" title="The popularity and user base of YouTube and Dailymotion"></a>The popularity and user base of YouTube and Dailymotion</h3><p>YouTube’s user interface is very easy and simple to use. You can filter the results with date and popularity at the top bar of the website. You can watch YouTube without ads and gain access to YouTube analytics.</p><p>It’s cool to create your own channel on YouTube. It allows you to upload videos, customize your banner, and create a community.</p><p>It is easy to stream videos or share them with friends by creating playlists. YouTube and Dailymotion both have easy-to-use interfaces. You can customize your own channel, and it has categories and channels. YouTube has advanced playlist features, but Dailymotion does not.</p><p>It’s not all fun and games - YouTube has fewer ads than Dailymotion. A premium subscription to Dailymotion removes the ads and gives you access to other features.</p><h3 id="Both-Platforms-have-Different-Content-and-Audiences-1"><a href="#Both-Platforms-have-Different-Content-and-Audiences-1" class="headerlink" title="Both Platforms have Different Content and Audiences"></a>Both Platforms have Different Content and Audiences</h3><h4 id="YouTube-Content-and-Audience-1"><a href="#YouTube-Content-and-Audience-1" class="headerlink" title="YouTube Content and Audience"></a>YouTube Content and Audience</h4><p>Video content on YouTube ranges from cooking tips to music videos.

Let’s have a look at the monetization options available on YouTube and Dailymotion. It is possible to earn money from your content on both Dailymotion and YouTube. Dailymotion is easier to monetize, despite its broader and more sophisticated offering.</p><h4 id="Programs-and-options-for-monetizing-YouTube-1"><a href="#Programs-and-options-for-monetizing-YouTube-1" class="headerlink" title="Programs and options for monetizing YouTube"></a>Programs and options for monetizing YouTube</h4><p>There are many ways for YouTube creators to make money from their content.

Dailymotion has fewer monetization options than YouTube. Unlike YouTube, Dailymotion allows creators to earn money through ads.</p><p>The Dailymotion Partner Program has made several French video creators extremely wealthy. The CPM is always low for video creators around the world, for whatever reason. Dailymotion Partners from France earn 3000 - 4000 euros per month. Global Partners withdraw the monthly least of $100.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/Dailymotion-Monetization-vs-YouTube-Which-Is-More-Profitable-4.jpg"                      alt="programs and options for dailymotion monetization"                ></p><h3 id="Monetization-Requirements-and-Earning-Potential-1"><a href="#Monetization-Requirements-and-Earning-Potential-1" class="headerlink" title="Monetization Requirements and Earning Potential"></a>Monetization Requirements and Earning Potential</h3><p>YouTube’s YPP monetizes accounts with 1,000 subscribers and earns revenue through advertising.

What’s the ideal YouTube thumbnail Size and Dimension?"></a><strong>1. What’s the ideal YouTube thumbnail Size and Dimension?</strong></h2><p>An essential thing that every YouTube video developer needs to know is about the selection of the right side of the thumbnail for any video. As per the guidelines circulated by Google itself, the most appropriate size for the thumbnail image is 1280x720 pixels, where the recommended minimal pixel width is 640 pixels. Generally, the 16:9 ratio is considered as an ideal choice for Most of YouTube previews and players.</p><p>Here is one interesting thing that you need to know; the thumbnail of videos appears smaller during searches, but it naturally grows to the full size of a video during suggestions. Now the fact is that upscaling of images often loses the quality of content, whereas it is much easier to downscale larger images into smaller ones. Hence, the best idea is to use large size images so that this search and suggestion based scaling needs can be well accomplished.</p><p><strong>You May Also Like:</strong><br><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Top 12 Best Free YouTube Thumbnail Makers &gt;&gt; <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a><br><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" > How to Download YouTube Thumbnail in 3 Ways [Online&#x2F;Win&#x2F;Mac] &gt;&gt; <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://imp.i357552.net/c/5597632/1001453/11832" target="_top" id="1001453">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/11832-1001453" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.i357552.net/i/5597632/1001453/11832"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="2-Tips-for-Perfect-Thumbnails"><a href="#2-Tips-for-Perfect-Thumbnails" class="headerlink" title="2.

And it’s to be expected because Youtubers have been making content for way longer than TickTokers.</p><p>For example, MrBeast posted his first video on YouTube in 2012, and it has been about 10 years since he created his content.</p><p><strong>Are Highest-Paid YouTube Stars Always Trending?</strong></p><p>Since the highest-paid YouTubers make so much money, you may think they are always “Trending” on YouTube.</p><p>Sorry to pop your bubble, but they are not.</p><p>The highest-paid YouTubers may have a ton of subscribers, but being in “Trending” is different.</p><p>The most important reason is that the “Trending” part of YouTube shows popular videos in the specific area of the users, so it varies depending upon the user’s location.</p><h2 id="Final-Words-1"><a href="#Final-Words-1" class="headerlink" title="Final Words"></a>Final Words</h2><p>The world’s biggest video-sharing platform, YouTube, offers an opportunity to all content creators.</p><p>And those who get on the top strike a fortune without a doubt.</p><p>The top 10 highest-paid YouTubers are listed in this article who are making millions of dollars with their YouTube channel.</p><p>And if you also want to create first-class YouTube videos just like them, try using <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Wondershare Filmora <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> for editing your videos before uploading them on YouTube.</p><p>Thanks for reading, folks.</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Free Download <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> For Win 7 or later(64-bit)</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Free Download <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> For macOS 10.14 or later</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://some-guidance.techidaily.com/new-streamline-split-and-save-going-beyond-xsplit/"><u>[New] Streamline, Split & Save Going Beyond XSplit</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-tips.techidaily.com/ed-youtube-shorts-music-things-you-need-to-know-for-2024/"><u>[Updated] YouTube Shorts Music - Things You Need to Know for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-skills.techidaily.com/2024-approved-journey-to-metaverse-leading-vr-headsets-reviewed/"><u>2024 Approved Journey to Metaverse Leading VR Headsets Reviewed</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-tips.techidaily.com/cting-biggest-fifa-footage-trends-in-graphs/"><u>Dissecting Biggest FIFA Footage Trends in Graphs</u></a></li><li><a href="https://tech-revival.techidaily.com/download-directx-on-windows-11-and-10-simple-steps-fast-results/"><u>Download DirectX on Windows 11 & 10: Simple Steps, Fast Results</u></a></li><li><a href="https://techidaily.com/how-to-soft-reset-motorola-moto-e13-phone-drfone-by-drfone-reset-android-reset-android/"><u>How to Soft Reset Motorola Moto E13 phone? | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://iphone-location.techidaily.com/in-2024-does-pokegoplusplus-still-work-on-apple-iphone-15-proipad-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-ios/"><u>In 2024, Does PokeGo++ still work on Apple iPhone 15 Pro/iPad? | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-tips.techidaily.com/24-end-screen-magic-free-templates-to-boost-video-appeal/"><u>In 2024, End-Screen Magic Free Templates to Boost Video Appeal</u></a></li><li><a href="https://some-techniques.techidaily.com/in-2024-expert-guide-to-changing-user-numbers-on-tiktok/"><u>In 2024, Expert Guide to Changing User Numbers on TikTok</u></a></li><li><a href="https://android-pokemon-go.techidaily.com/in-2024-why-is-ipogo-not-working-on-lava-blaze-curve-5g-fixed-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/"><u>In 2024, Why is iPogo not working On Lava Blaze Curve 5G?

Dailymotion: Key Platform Distinctions</h2><h1 id="What-is-the-Difference-between-YouTube-and-Dailymotion"><a href="#What-is-the-Difference-between-YouTube-and-Dailymotion" class="headerlink" title="What is the Difference between YouTube and Dailymotion"></a>What is the Difference between YouTube and Dailymotion</h1><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/ollie-mattison.jpg"                      alt="author avatar"                ></p><h5 id="Ollie-Mattison"><a href="#Ollie-Mattison" class="headerlink" title="Ollie Mattison"></a>Ollie Mattison</h5><p> Mar 27, 2024• Proven solutions</p><p><strong>YouTube:</strong> YouTube is a well-known website for watching all kind of videos. It was launched in February 2005 and today it is serving like one of the biggest social media network. This platform was actually designed by few creative PayPal workers.</p><p><strong>Dailymotion:</strong> It is a French social site and one popular competitor against YouTube. This site was launched by Orange on 15th March, 2005. You can watch wide range of videos on Dailymotion but for limited duration of time.</p><blockquote><p> Disclaimer: This post includes affiliate links</p><p> If you click on a link and make a purchase, I may receive a commission at no extra cost to you.</p></blockquote><h2 id="Difference-between-YouTube-and-Dailymotion"><a href="#Difference-between-YouTube-and-Dailymotion" class="headerlink" title="Difference between YouTube and Dailymotion"></a>Difference between YouTube and Dailymotion</h2><p> Here we few key terms that can help you to understand difference between YouTube and Dailymotion:</p><h4 id="1-Numbers"><a href="#1-Numbers" class="headerlink" title="1.Numbers"></a>1.Numbers</h4><p> The total number of viewers that interact with site like Dailymotion and YouTube is actually one of the important parameter for business because it decides the number of video ads and text that will be placed on site. We all know that YouTube is world’s biggest network for videos and Dailymotion follows it at second number. Statistics reveal that there are so many advantages of YouTube over Dailymotion, especially in terms of total site visitors as YouTube gets billions of visitors per month but this count is limited to 112 million visitors in case of Dailymotion.</p><h4 id="2-3D-Videos"><a href="#2-3D-Videos" class="headerlink" title="2.3D Videos"></a>2.3D Videos</h4><p> 3D videos are one of the biggest needs of viewers these days so its availability on site definitely boosts site importance in market. As YouTube is developed with Beta so it is capable enough to provide impressive 3D viewing experience to viewers but on the other side, Dailymotion lacks behind in this capability. You cannot enjoy 3D content on Dailymotion screens.</p><h4 id="3-Video-Quality"><a href="#3-Video-Quality" class="headerlink" title="3.Video Quality"></a>3.Video Quality</h4><p> One more important criterion for comparison between YouTube and Dailymotion is the overall allowed time limit for video uploads. In case of Dailymotion, you will often find all videos with less than 60 minute duration but on YouTube, video can be of any big length as it never poses any restriction on the basis of time duration. Here is one wonderful thing to know that on YouTube videos of worth 72 hour duration are uploaded per second. And viewers in YouTube are capable enough to watch fresh videos day and night.</p><p> Sadly, Dailymotion cannot give you this much freedom about content and naturally here YouTube again stays on advantageous side for users. May be this is the biggest reason behind billions of having visitors on YouTube platform as compared to only 112 million visitors over Dailymotion.</p><h4 id="4-Analytics"><a href="#4-Analytics" class="headerlink" title="4.Analytics"></a>4.Analytics</h4><p> You might be aware about the fact that YouTube is owned by Behemoth Google; that is why it possesses most robust analytics tools as like YouTube insights. With these advanced tools, businesses as well as individuals can monitor their viewers on videos. They can also make analysis about how long and how often a particular visitor stays on videos. It helps businesses to improve their video content so that more visitors can be attracted. Dailymotion cannot offer you such details, here you can access just publication date of video, nothing else. The true fact is that Dailymotion itself has a YouTube channel that users often access to upload multiple videos so that Dailymotion can avail some promotions.</p><h2 id="Tips-for-Editing-YouTube-and-Dailymotion-Videos"><a href="#Tips-for-Editing-YouTube-and-Dailymotion-Videos" class="headerlink" title="Tips for Editing YouTube and Dailymotion Videos"></a>Tips for Editing YouTube and Dailymotion Videos</h2><p> If you often watch, download or upload videos on YouTube and Dailymotion platform then you may also need to edit them time to time. In order to fulfil this need you may need editing software. Professionals recommend Wondershare Filmora as one of the best and easiest editing tool with wide range of features. It can process more than 150 video file formats so you can easily edit whatever you want to customize.</p><p><a href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-win.jpg"                      alt="Download Win Version"                > </a> <a href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-mac.jpg"                      alt="Download Mac Version"                > </a></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/ollie-mattison.jpg"                      alt="author avatar"                ></p><p>Ollie Mattison</p><p>Ollie Mattison is a writer and a lover of all things video.</p><p>Follow @Ollie Mattison</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://fox-access.techidaily.com/new-2024-approved-the-method-for-seamless-volume-dialing-down-in-audacity/"><u>[New] 2024 Approved The Method for Seamless Volume Dialing Down in Audacity</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-tips.techidaily.com/asy-guide-to-youtube-livestreaming-from-google-meet/"><u>[New] Easy Guide to YouTube Livestreaming From Google Meet</u></a></li><li><a href="https://screen-activity-recording.techidaily.com/new-in-2024-in-depth-look-at-bandicams-functionality-for-video-creation/"><u>[New] In 2024, In-Depth Look at Bandicam's Functionality for Video Creation</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-tips.techidaily.com/ed-pioneering-video-design-on-a-shoestring-exclusive-tutorials-for-free-from-top-4-youtube-vfx-channels-for-2024/"><u>[Updated] Pioneering Video Design on a Shoestring Exclusive Tutorials for Free From Top 4 YouTube VFX Channels for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-tips.techidaily.com/ed-unlimited-christmas-classics-9-films-available-for-no-charge-in-2024/"><u>[Updated] Unlimited Christmas Classics 9 Films Available for No Charge, In 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-tips.techidaily.com/ed-why-youtube-premium-should-be-on-everyones-radar-for-2024/"><u>[Updated] Why YouTube Premium Should Be on Everyone's Radar for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://blog-min.techidaily.com/how-to-transfer-contacts-from-honor-90-gt-to-phone-drfone-by-drfone-transfer-from-android-transfer-from-android/"><u>How to Transfer Contacts from Honor 90 GT To Phone | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://screen-mirror.techidaily.com/how-to-use-allshare-cast-to-turn-on-screen-mirroring-on-oppo-reno-10-pro-5g-drfone-by-drfone-android/"><u>How To Use Allshare Cast To Turn On Screen Mirroring On Oppo Reno 10 Pro 5G | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://review-topics.techidaily.com/huawei-p60-video-recovery-recover-deleted-videos-from-huawei-p60-by-fonelab-android-recover-video/"><u>Huawei P60 Video Recovery -

You can get by for a long time setting your camera up on a stack of books, or an upside-down laundry hamper, but not forever. While these setups are great for a beginner, an intermediate vlogger will start to find them limiting. Even if you are an amazingly creative person who can create any camera setup without a tripod there will come a point where you will decide your creative energy is better spent on your video content.</p><p> This article will explain how to use a tripod and then introduce you to four different types.</p><blockquote><p> Disclaimer: This post includes affiliate links</p><p> If you click on a link and make a purchase, I may receive a commission at no extra cost to you.</p></blockquote><h2 id="Part-1-How-To-Set-a-Tripod-for-Vlogging"><a href="#Part-1-How-To-Set-a-Tripod-for-Vlogging" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: How To Set a Tripod for Vlogging"></a>Part 1: How To Set a Tripod for Vlogging</h2><h4 id="1-Setting-Up-Your-Tripod"><a href="#1-Setting-Up-Your-Tripod" class="headerlink" title="1. Setting Up Your Tripod"></a>1. Setting Up Your Tripod</h4><p><strong>Step 1 –</strong> Pull out all three legs of your tripod and make sure it is standing stably. There will be tensioners on the legs which you can release in order to adjust your height. Once your legs are extended to the height you want continue adjusting them until your tripod is level. Some tripods have a built in bubble level, but if yours does not you can use a separate bubble level or make a guestimate.</p><p> Make sure when you are setting up your tripod that you point one of its legs towards your subject. This will give you room to stand behind your camera, in-between the other two legs. If you have one leg pointed directly behind your camera then you may trip over it. Or, you may knock over and damage your camera.</p><p><strong>Step 2 –</strong> On the top of your tripod there will be a plate with a small hole and a screw. Remove this plate using either a clip or lever, depending on your tripod. Once your plate is detached screw it into the bottom of your camera. It should be tight, but not too tight or you risk damaging your camera.</p><p><strong>Step 3 –</strong> Attach your plate, which now has your camera mounted to it, back onto your tripod.</p><p> Your tripod comes with a ‘head’. Your tripod’s head is what your camera is mounted on top of. There are several different types of tripod heads and mounts which are all useful for different things.</p><p> Ball Heads and Pan&#x2F;Tilt Heads are the two most common types of tripod heads. Ball Heads allow you to adjust your camera’s position quite a bit before you start shooting. They are not good for adding in camera movements while you are filming, however, because you need to lock them in place. Pan&#x2F;Tilt heads are great for creating camera movement. Most Pan&#x2F;Tilt heads have a handle which you can use to make a smooth panning motion.</p><h2 id="Part-2-Why-Do-You-Need-a-Tripod-Benefits-of-Using-Tripod"><a href="#Part-2-Why-Do-You-Need-a-Tripod-Benefits-of-Using-Tripod" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: Why Do You Need a Tripod: Benefits of Using Tripod"></a>Part 2: Why Do You Need a Tripod: Benefits of Using Tripod</h2><p> Why can’t you just hold a camera in your hand while shooting vlog entries for your YouTube channel? Honestly, you can, but the camera may shake a lot and your footage might end up being unusable. Putting a camera on a tripod reduces the probability of camera shake to the minimum and that is just the tip of the iceberg.</p><p> A huge amount of vlogs can be described as sit down videos, in which the host of the video sits in front of a camera and talks to the audience. Holding a camera while talking or trying to present a product to the viewers is next to impossible, so in order to avoid having to deal with a camera, you can simply put it on a tripod, find the best angle, and push the record button.</p><p> On the go videos, are recorded at exterior locations, and a lot of YouTubers choose to shoot these types of videos handheld, but this approach makes it difficult to maintain the same shot composition for long. A Monopod, Gorillapod or just a simple selfie stick can make your job much easier because they stabilize the camera. In addition, shooting smooth panning shots without a tripod is as difficult as it sounds.</p><h2 id="Part-3-A-Few-Things-You’ll-Need-to-Consider-Before-You-Buy-a-Tripod"><a href="#Part-3-A-Few-Things-You’ll-Need-to-Consider-Before-You-Buy-a-Tripod" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: A Few Things You’ll Need to Consider Before You Buy a Tripod"></a>Part 3: A Few Things You’ll Need to Consider Before You Buy a Tripod</h2><p> There are thousands of different tripod models you can use for vlogging, but which model you’re going to choose depends mostly on the type of vlog you want to make. If you are planning on shooting all of your videos in the studio-like conditions, then portability isn’t such an important feature, while quite the opposite is true if you intend on filming all of your footage on outdoor locations.</p><p> However, there are certain traits you have to consider when choosing a tripod you’re going to use while recording your vlog entries.</p><p><strong>Sturdiness:</strong> There is absolutely no point in spending money on a tripod that breaks easily. Although if your plan is to shoot vlogs at home or in a studio, then buying a cheaper plastic tripod isn’t such a bad option, since the clamps and joints won’t have to endure a lot of wear and tear. Consider buying a more durable tripod if you are going to be traveling a lot while working on your vlogs.</p><p><strong>The Type of Camera:</strong> A number of factors can contribute to the weight of a camera, including battery grips or lenses, so before you buy a tripod make sure that it can support the weight of the camera you want to use to record your videos.</p><p><strong>The Maximum Height:</strong> Most vloggers don’t really have to worry about how tall their tripod is, because they are not on their feet in any of the shots featured in the video. Vloggers working on DIY videos, cooking tutorials or any other type of vlog that involves movement and action should pay attention to this trait.</p><p><strong>Photo or Video Tripods:</strong> Do you want to take beautiful panning shots? If the answer is yes then you should get a video tripod that enables you to move the camera smoothly in any direction. Photo tripods are a great option for static shots that don’t involve a lot of camera movement.</p><p> <strong>Mobility:</strong> The heavier a tripod is, the more stability it can provide, but carrying a tripod that weighs over 10 pounds to shoot sports or adventure vlogs can be a tiring endeavor. Although portability is a factor, it shouldn’t prevent you from buying a high-quality tripod that will ensure your footage is perfectly smooth and stable.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/1902294/19272" target="_top" id="1902294">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-1902294" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/1902294/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Part-4-4-Types-of-Tripods"><a href="#Part-4-4-Types-of-Tripods" class="headerlink" title="Part 4: 4 Types of Tripods"></a>Part 4: 4 Types of Tripods</h2><p><strong>Full-Sized Tripods:</strong> are very sturdy, and as a result can be fairly heavy. Although you can take them a lot of places they are not convenient to carry for extended periods of time. They are the most reliable way to ensure you have absolutely no camera shake.</p><p><strong>Compact Tripods:</strong> appear to be the same size as Full-Sized tripods, but they are actually much lighter. You can get the same height with a Compact Tripod as a Full-Sized tripod and it will be much easier to travel with. However, Compact Tripods are not as stable. If you are shooting for an extended period of time you may need to weigh your Compact Tripod down with sandbags to keep it steady.</p><p><strong>Gorillapods:</strong> have flexible legs which can be wrapped around posts, fences, or anything else you may want to mount your camera on. They are also lightweight enough that you can carry them around while you shoot. If you bend it right you can essentially use your Gorillapod as a heavy-duty selfie-stick for your camera.</p><p><strong>Table-Top Tripods:</strong> are very small and easy to travel with. You can leave one in your camera bag or your glove box. Table-Top Tripods are meant to be set up on top of desks or other stable surfaces and may not be ideal for heavier cameras.</p><h2 id="Part-5-The-5-Best-Tripods-For-YouTube-Vlogging"><a href="#Part-5-The-5-Best-Tripods-For-YouTube-Vlogging" class="headerlink" title="Part 5: The 5 Best Tripods For YouTube Vlogging"></a>Part 5: The 5 Best Tripods For YouTube Vlogging</h2><p> Even if you know everything there is to know about tripods, the selection process can be daunting.

If your art does not look like it all goes together then people will get a sloppy, amateurish, impression of your channel. However, if your different pieces of channel art all seem to complement each other and match the tone and theme of your channel then it will help viewers to have a pleasant browsing experience. They will get the impression that you take your YouTube channel seriously and that they can trust you as a source of information, comedy, or general entertainment.</p><h2 id="How-to-Make-YouTube-Banners-and-Thumbnails-1"><a href="#How-to-Make-YouTube-Banners-and-Thumbnails-1" class="headerlink" title="How to Make YouTube Banners and Thumbnails"></a>How to Make YouTube Banners and Thumbnails</h2><p>YouTube Banners and Thumbnails are two of the most important pieces of channel art you will need. This article will explain the best practices for both, and suggest sites where you will be able to build your own banners and thumbnails for free.</p><h4 id="1-YouTube-Banners"><a href="#1-YouTube-Banners" class="headerlink" title="1. YouTube Banners"></a>1. YouTube Banners</h4><p><strong>Quick Tips:</strong></p><ol><li>The image you upload for your YouTube banner should be 2560 x 1440px (pixels).</li><li>The ‘safe area’ for text, logos, and other important visual information (like faces) is 1546 x 423px.</li></ol><p>Your banner is probably the first thing that comes to mind when you think about channel art. Banners are the headers that rest at the tops of channel pages on YouTube. Your banner should be 2560 x 1440 px, although not all of it will always be visible. On a desktop computer or mobile device only a 1546 x 423 px ‘safe area’ will be visible. When viewed on a TV screen your entire image will be visible. YouTube does support PNG, but if your PNG file does not upload properly (as has been the case for some YouTubers) then changing your file type to JPEG might help.</p><p>YouTube Banners are extremely important to the success of your channel. If you do not have a banner then it looks like you do not really care about your vlog. If you have a basic banner that is not at all personalized then it certainly looks like you care, but it might also look like you are new to YouTube.</p><p>The best banners are customized to reflect the kind of experience you want viewers to have on your channel. The banner of a comedic YouTube channel might use bright colors, where the banner for a gaming channel will probably use darker colors similar to the ones that are in the games the vlogger plays. Connecting your banner to the theme of your channel is part of how you define the style of your vlog. It is the difference between being a Beauty Guru and a general YouTuber who gives makeup tips sometimes.</p><p>Including a photo of yourself, or your logo if you have one, is a great way to personalize your banner.</p><h4 id="2-YouTube-Thumbnails"><a href="#2-YouTube-Thumbnails" class="headerlink" title="2. YouTube Thumbnails"></a>2. YouTube Thumbnails</h4><p><strong>Quick Tips:</strong></p><ol><li>Search for your video’s topic to see the thumbnails your thumbnail will be competing against.</li><li>Make any text huge so people can read it on their smartphone screens.</li><li>Emojis, colored boarders, and graphics are all potential ways to stand out.</li></ol><p>Thumbnails are often ignored by newer YouTubers. YouTube selects a thumbnail for every one of your videos and it is always a still image from that video. You can choose which frame you want to use and a lot of people feel like that is good enough. When you create a custom thumbnail, however, you get to not only choose your image but insert a title.</p><p>If you are choosing the images you are using for thumbnails you can make sure they are always similar frames. This will help people identify your videos quickly in searches. Using titles in your thumbnails will also help searchers identify your videos, if you always use the same title style. Another benefit of titles is that they capture the attention of people looking for your specific topic. Remember when building your thumbnails that they will appear smaller on YouTube than they probably are while you edit them. On mobile devices, they will look even smaller. So, if you are going to use text in your thumbnail, make sure it is huge.</p><p>One thumbnail taboo that you should never break is using an image that has nothing to do with your video. Using an image of a cute cat for a vlog post that has nothing to do with cats is misleading and will anger viewers. You may draw in a lot of viewers who want to see a cat video, but they will leave right away when they do not see a cat and they will never watch anything by you again.</p><h4 id="3-Where-To-Create-Banners-and-Thumbnails"><a href="#3-Where-To-Create-Banners-and-Thumbnails" class="headerlink" title="3.Where To Create Banners and Thumbnails"></a>3.Where To Create Banners and Thumbnails</h4><p>There are sites online that will allow you to edit images and use them in templates for YouTube banners. You can also use these services to edit your thumbnails. Two of the most popular, free, online photo editors are PicMonkey.com and Canva.com.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/banner-n-thumb-Canva.JPG"                      alt="banner n thumb Canva"                ></p><p><strong>Canva</strong> has templates you can use to create YouTube banners, as well as a variety of stock images you can use in combination with your own when creating channel art. It is free to edit images on Canva, but they do have some premium features which cost $1 each to access. This service has both a desktop version and an iPad app.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/banner-n-thumb-PicMonkey.JPG"                      alt="banner n thumb PicMonkey"                ></p><p><strong>PicMonkey</strong> lets you import images from your computer or social media accounts, edit them, and use them in templates for YouTube banners or other kinds of social media graphics. PicMonkey is free to use, but you can only access their more advanced editing tools if you buy a paid subscription. Monthly subscriptions are $4.99 per month, and yearly subscriptions are $2.75 per month.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/richard-bennett.jpg"                      alt="author avatar"                ></p><p>Richard Bennett</p><p>Richard Bennett is a writer and a lover of all things video.</p><p>Follow @Richard Bennett</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://extra-approaches.techidaily.com/new-must-see-upgrades-in-vr-armor/"><u>[New] Must-See Upgrades in VR Armor</u></a></li><li><a href="https://some-approaches.techidaily.com/updated-swift-solutions-for-the-windows-10-photos-app-stability-woes/"><u>[Updated] Swift Solutions for the Window's 10 Photos App Stability Woes</u></a></li><li><a href="https://some-tips.techidaily.com/updated-unveil-image-by-removing-surroundings/"><u>[Updated] Unveil Image by Removing Surroundings</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-tips.techidaily.com/ed-youtube-success-starts-here-best-tutorials-for-starters/"><u>[Updated] YouTube Success Starts Here Best Tutorials for Starters</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-tips.techidaily.com/ed-youtubes-top-12-choices-in-gamers-introductory-videos-freepaid-for-2024/"><u>[Updated] YouTube's Top 12 Choices in Gamers' Introductory Videos (Free/Paid) for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-skills.techidaily.com/2024-approved-sci-fis-new-frontiers-a-compilation-of-incredible-metaverse-movie-experiences/"><u>2024 Approved Sci-Fi's New Frontiers A Compilation of Incredible Metaverse Movie Experiences</u></a></li><li><a href="https://vp-tips.techidaily.com/bare-bones-budget-friendly-best-5-windows-10-recording-apps/"><u>Bare-Bones, Budget-Friendly Best 5 Windows 10 Recording Apps</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-tips.techidaily.com/thing-you-need-to-know-about-youtube-basic-and-premium/"><u>Everything You Need to Know About YouTube Basic & Premium</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-tips.techidaily.com/c-video-titles-youtubes-most-watched-lore/"><u>Iconic Video Titles YouTube's Most-Watched Lore</u></a></li></ul></div><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2144279/7443" target="_top" id="2144279">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2144279" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2144279/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end -->]]></content>

A 24-year-old Salvadoran named Luis Fernando Flores Alvarado is the man behind one of the most subscribed YouTube channels of all time. The Fernanfloo channel was created in 2011, and in February 2014 it had only 100,000 subscribers. By August 2014, Alvarado’s channel reached 1 million subscribers, making him one of YouTube’s biggest success stories. The videos featured on Feranfloo channel mostly cover gaming topics, but with a touch of comedy which makes Alvarado’s videos unique.</p><p>At the end of 2015, Alvarado launched the Fenanfloo mobile app that had 2.3 million downloads in the first week. His videos are mostly in Spanish which somewhat limits his audience, but it is safe to say the Fernanfloo channel is among the most popular channels in the Latin American countries since most of his audience comes from Bolivia, Peru, and Ecuador.</p><p> For tips on becoming YouTube famous like the creators above, <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/"

It has supplied so much information that it took this <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >comprehensive post about Analytics <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> to highlight all the insights. So why would YouTube change it?</p><p>Change to a popular social media platform is always worrisome to content creators because it means there will be a new learning phase forced upon them. While the Classic YouTube Creator Studio has a lot of features and functionality, the data was often hard to interpret and inconvenient to find. Many creators weren’t sure where their data was located or how to use the information presented to them.</p><p>YouTube Studio was designed to be a friendly management and analysis tool. YouTube also offers more guidance, showcasing the key metrics the algorithm uses to evaluate the success of a video more prominently. Additionally, the graphs presented offer more clarity, shortening the time a creator spends finding the information they need.</p><p>Undoubtedly, YouTube updated its Creator Studio to offer a tool that enables its users to better understand their video performance and make better content that serves YouTube’s requirements.</p><h2 id="Intro-to-YouTube-Studio-Beta"><a href="#Intro-to-YouTube-Studio-Beta" class="headerlink" title="Intro to YouTube Studio (Beta)"></a>Intro to YouTube Studio (Beta)</h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/youtube-studio-beta.jpg"                      alt=" YouTube Studio Beta"                ></p><p>YouTube Studio (Beta), for many YouTubers, is now the default. However, for the time being, creators can still switch back to the Classic view (as some of the features are still being built). YouTube’s objective is to receive data of their own by understanding how creators are using the new Studio and gaining feedback to improve upon it.</p><p>If you have any feedback, simply click on this button on the bottom left menu of the YouTube Studio (Beta) and send YouTube your thoughts.</p><p>In addition to the new layout of the tools and dashboards, YouTube Studio (Beta) will also debut 3 metrics for creators:</p><p><strong>1. Impressions</strong>: See the total reach of all your videos or each individual video. Each time your video thumbnail and title are visible to the user counts as an impression.</p><p><strong>2. Click-through rate</strong>: Determine how click-worthy your thumbnails and titles are, by seeing the percentage of people who click into your video.</p><p><strong>3. Unique viewers</strong>: Know how many different people have watched your videos. This data can be used to compare the size of your subscriber base to the actual number of your audience.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/1918661/19272" target="_top" id="1918661">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-1918661" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="300" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/1918661/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Tips-for-Using-YouTube-Studio-Beta-Features"><a href="#Tips-for-Using-YouTube-Studio-Beta-Features" class="headerlink" title="Tips for Using YouTube Studio Beta Features"></a>Tips for Using YouTube Studio Beta Features</h2><p>Now that you are more familiar with the new YouTube Studio (Beta), let us dive into what you can accomplish with all the new features.</p><h4 id="1-Optimization-Tips"><a href="#1-Optimization-Tips" class="headerlink" title="1.

In order for YouTube to determine whether your content is worth sharing, it wants to know how your audience is responding to it right away. This means, the launch of your video matters.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/youtube-studio-beta-recent-video-data.jpg"                      alt="YouTube Studio Video Analysis"                ></p><h4 id="3-Video-Analysis"><a href="#3-Video-Analysis" class="headerlink" title="3.

Watch Time Funnel"></a>4. Watch Time Funnel</h4><p>The objective is to increase watch time, the metric YouTube puts the most weight on. With the new Watch Time Funnel, which you can find in the Analytics section under the Reach Viewer dashboard, you can see exactly at which level of your channel or wherein an individual video you will need to improve.</p><p>If the impression numbers are low, that means you need to improve how your video is being discovered by doing more research to understand what your viewers are searching for.</p><p>If the click-through rate (CTR) is low, then you will have to improve your thumbnail and title. This will better entice your audience to click.

In turn, this will allow you to ensure your content appears in top search results more often. With that in mind, here are some factors that affect your YouTube ranking.</p><h4 id="Video-Title"><a href="#Video-Title" class="headerlink" title="Video Title"></a>Video Title</h4><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/youtube-video-ranking-1.png"                      alt="factors that affect youtube video ranking"                ></p><p>YouTube videos number in the many millions.

Metadata is one of the YouTube ranking factors; this includes your video title. Essentially, titles give the first impression of any video to end users, YouTube, and search engines.</p><p>A well-titled video attracts more traffic, which translates to more views. Experts recommend using short titles that immediately get to the meat and potatoes of what the video entails. Avoid long titles as some devices, browsers, and search engines can cut them off.</p><p>Video titles should have five words or less. Don’t forget to place keywords at the beginning of the title. The keywords should also be relevant to your video.</p><h4 id="Video-Description"><a href="#Video-Description" class="headerlink" title="Video Description"></a>Video Description</h4><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/youtube-video-ranking-2.png"                      alt="factors that affect youtube video ranking - video description"                ></p><p>When many videos on the same or similar topics exist, content can seem repetitive to prospective viewers. Therefore, YouTubers should offer a short but detailed description of the information contained within. And above all, address how their video stands out from similar content.</p><p>Because Google and YouTube cannot extract information from videos, they use text descriptions to define the content on videos. Therefore, if you do not include a description, search engines won’t know what your video is about: this might affect your ranking.</p><p>Make sure your video description is 250 words or more. Additionally, include relevant and suitable keywords.</p><p>When writing the description, you can place the main keyword in your first 25 words and then link to external URLs; for instance, you could link to related blog content or your social media channels.</p><h4 id="Video-Quality"><a href="#Video-Quality" class="headerlink" title="Video Quality"></a>Video Quality</h4><p>Poor quality is an immediate buzz kill. Few people can bear to watch a video with poor sound or picture quality. In many instances, quality is one of the YouTube ranking factors. HD (high-definition) videos rank higher than lower-quality ones. YouTube often highlights HD videos in its top search results.</p><p>Filmora can help you improve the quality of your videos, which will make them rank higher. The software allows you to edit your video and change its hue, brightness, saturation, and contrast. You can also crop, cut, and trim your videos.</p><p>What’s more? Filmora allows you to adjust output volume, pitch, fade-in, and fade-out to make your video clear. Once you have finished creating your HD video, you can head to the Export tab and select Upload to YouTube to publish your video on your channel.</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Try It Free <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>For Win 7 or later (64-bit)</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Try It Free <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>For macOS 10.12 or later</p><h4 id="Watch-Time"><a href="#Watch-Time" class="headerlink" title="Watch Time"></a>Watch Time</h4><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/youtube-video-ranking-4.png"                      alt="factors that affect youtube video ranking - watch time"                ></p><p>Watch Time is also among the YouTube ranking factors. According to YouTube, Watch Time is the total length of time people spend watching your videos.</p><p>YouTube’s algorithm prioritizes videos leading to longer viewing sessions over the ones with more views. You can use Audience Retention Report and YouTube Analytics Views Report to find out which videos have the worst and best view times. Doing this will allow you to plan for your future content accordingly</p><p>Using annotations and leaving links to other videos in your description box can help you increase the length of your viewing sessions.</p><h4 id="Thumbnails"><a href="#Thumbnails" class="headerlink" title="Thumbnails"></a>Thumbnails</h4><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/youtube-video-ranking-5.png"                      alt="factors that affect youtube video ranking -Thumbnails"                ></p><p>Thumbnails have a positive effect on click-through rates when used the right way. You can use them to maximize your views and YouTube video ranking.</p><p>YouTube generates thumbnails by taking screenshots from videos. However, you might want to go for customized thumbnails, as this will allow you to stand out from your competitors and outperform their videos.</p><p>Make sure the image you use as your thumbnail is aesthetically pleasing and grabs the attention of viewers. Also, it should be relevant to the content in your video. Keep in mind that thumbnails with a 16:9 aspect ratio and a 1280-by-20-pixel resolution generally perform best.</p><h4 id="Number-of-Views"><a href="#Number-of-Views" class="headerlink" title="Number of Views"></a>Number of Views</h4><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/youtube-video-ranking-6.png"                      alt="factors that affect youtube video ranking -Number of Views"                ></p><p>Views are a vital YouTube ranking factor, as people are more likely to watch videos with a high number of views. The more views your video has, the higher it will rank, especially for competitive keywords.</p><p>If you want to rank high for competitive keywords, ensure that your videos get loads of views. For this reason, you have to take steps and get your video content on other platforms. In turn, you will increase the visibility of your videos and view count.</p><p>You could embed your videos into your blog posts or share them on social media platforms to get more people to watch them.</p><h4 id="Closed-Captions-and-Subtitles"><a href="#Closed-Captions-and-Subtitles" class="headerlink" title="Closed Captions and Subtitles"></a>Closed Captions and Subtitles</h4><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/youtube-video-ranking-7.png"                      alt="factors that affect youtube video ranking -Closed Captions and Subtitles"                ></p><p>Adding captions to videos with spoken-word content can improve your YouTube video ranking. Essentially, it opens up your videos to a larger audience, including people who are deaf and anyone speaking a different language from the one in your videos. Search engines also crawl close captions, which can boost your rankings.</p><p>While YouTube offers automatic captioning, it is not perfect. So you may need to make some edits or upload the captions yourself.</p><h2 id="How-to-Optimize-Your-YouTube-Ranking"><a href="#How-to-Optimize-Your-YouTube-Ranking" class="headerlink" title="How to Optimize Your YouTube Ranking"></a>How to Optimize Your YouTube Ranking</h2><h4 id="Focusing-on-User-Engagement"><a href="#Focusing-on-User-Engagement" class="headerlink" title="Focusing on User Engagement"></a>Focusing on User Engagement</h4><p>One of the best YouTube ranking optimization practices that you can implement is asking users to leave comments, like your videos, and share them. YouTube analyzes these metrics to determine the quality of your content. Ergo, if YouTube sees your video is engaging users, it will rank higher than those with little or no engagement.</p><h4 id="Using-Video-Hashtags"><a href="#Using-Video-Hashtags" class="headerlink" title="Using Video Hashtags"></a>Using Video Hashtags</h4><p>Hashtags help people to find content that provides answers to their questions across various platforms. Use related hashtags when creating your descriptions to ensure people find your videos when searching for specific hashtags.</p><p>Tags help drive search because they make main trends more visible. After adding a hashtag to the description, it will appear above the video title, and viewers will see it hyperlinked.</p><h4 id="Categorizing-Your-Video"><a href="#Categorizing-Your-Video" class="headerlink" title="Categorizing Your Video"></a>Categorizing Your Video</h4><p>After uploading your video, you should categorize it by going to Advanced settings. By choosing a category, YouTube will group your videos with similar content. Viewers will find your quickly, as they will come in the right audience searches. In turn, this will help your videos to rank higher.</p><h2 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>With 720,000 hours of video being uploaded every day to YouTube, getting your videos to rank high is challenging. But by paying attention to the above YouTube ranking factors, you can improve your video ranking.</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Try It Free <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Try It Free <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>Few social media mediums have grown more vital than YouTube.

And above all, address how their video stands out from similar content.</p><p>Because Google and YouTube cannot extract information from videos, they use text descriptions to define the content on videos. Therefore, if you do not include a description, search engines won’t know what your video is about: this might affect your ranking.</p><p>Make sure your video description is 250 words or more. Additionally, include relevant and suitable keywords.</p><p>When writing the description, you can place the main keyword in your first 25 words and then link to external URLs; for instance, you could link to related blog content or your social media channels.</p><h4 id="Video-Quality-3"><a href="#Video-Quality-3" class="headerlink" title="Video Quality"></a>Video Quality</h4><p>Poor quality is an immediate buzz kill. Few people can bear to watch a video with poor sound or picture quality. In many instances, quality is one of the YouTube ranking factors. HD (high-definition) videos rank higher than lower-quality ones. YouTube often highlights HD videos in its top search results.</p><p>Filmora can help you improve the quality of your videos, which will make them rank higher. The software allows you to edit your video and change its hue, brightness, saturation, and contrast. You can also crop, cut, and trim your videos.</p><p>What’s more? Filmora allows you to adjust output volume, pitch, fade-in, and fade-out to make your video clear. Once you have finished creating your HD video, you can head to the Export tab and select Upload to YouTube to publish your video on your channel.</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Try It Free <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>For Win 7 or later (64-bit)</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Try It Free <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>For macOS 10.12 or later</p><h4 id="Watch-Time-3"><a href="#Watch-Time-3" class="headerlink" title="Watch Time"></a>Watch Time</h4><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/youtube-video-ranking-4.png"                      alt="factors that affect youtube video ranking - watch time"                ></p><p>Watch Time is also among the YouTube ranking factors. According to YouTube, Watch Time is the total length of time people spend watching your videos.</p><p>YouTube’s algorithm prioritizes videos leading to longer viewing sessions over the ones with more views. You can use Audience Retention Report and YouTube Analytics Views Report to find out which videos have the worst and best view times. Doing this will allow you to plan for your future content accordingly</p><p>Using annotations and leaving links to other videos in your description box can help you increase the length of your viewing sessions.</p><h4 id="Thumbnails-3"><a href="#Thumbnails-3" class="headerlink" title="Thumbnails"></a>Thumbnails</h4><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/youtube-video-ranking-5.png"                      alt="factors that affect youtube video ranking -Thumbnails"                ></p><p>Thumbnails have a positive effect on click-through rates when used the right way. You can use them to maximize your views and YouTube video ranking.</p><p>YouTube generates thumbnails by taking screenshots from videos. However, you might want to go for customized thumbnails, as this will allow you to stand out from your competitors and outperform their videos.</p><p>Make sure the image you use as your thumbnail is aesthetically pleasing and grabs the attention of viewers. Also, it should be relevant to the content in your video. Keep in mind that thumbnails with a 16:9 aspect ratio and a 1280-by-20-pixel resolution generally perform best.</p><h4 id="Number-of-Views-3"><a href="#Number-of-Views-3" class="headerlink" title="Number of Views"></a>Number of Views</h4><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/youtube-video-ranking-6.png"                      alt="factors that affect youtube video ranking -Number of Views"                ></p><p>Views are a vital YouTube ranking factor, as people are more likely to watch videos with a high number of views. The more views your video has, the higher it will rank, especially for competitive keywords.</p><p>If you want to rank high for competitive keywords, ensure that your videos get loads of views. For this reason, you have to take steps and get your video content on other platforms. In turn, you will increase the visibility of your videos and view count.</p><p>You could embed your videos into your blog posts or share them on social media platforms to get more people to watch them.</p><h4 id="Closed-Captions-and-Subtitles-3"><a href="#Closed-Captions-and-Subtitles-3" class="headerlink" title="Closed Captions and Subtitles"></a>Closed Captions and Subtitles</h4><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/youtube-video-ranking-7.png"                      alt="factors that affect youtube video ranking -Closed Captions and Subtitles"                ></p><p>Adding captions to videos with spoken-word content can improve your YouTube video ranking. Essentially, it opens up your videos to a larger audience, including people who are deaf and anyone speaking a different language from the one in your videos. Search engines also crawl close captions, which can boost your rankings.</p><p>While YouTube offers automatic captioning, it is not perfect. So you may need to make some edits or upload the captions yourself.</p><h2 id="How-to-Optimize-Your-YouTube-Ranking-3"><a href="#How-to-Optimize-Your-YouTube-Ranking-3" class="headerlink" title="How to Optimize Your YouTube Ranking"></a>How to Optimize Your YouTube Ranking</h2><h4 id="Focusing-on-User-Engagement-3"><a href="#Focusing-on-User-Engagement-3" class="headerlink" title="Focusing on User Engagement"></a>Focusing on User Engagement</h4><p>One of the best YouTube ranking optimization practices that you can implement is asking users to leave comments, like your videos, and share them. YouTube analyzes these metrics to determine the quality of your content. Ergo, if YouTube sees your video is engaging users, it will rank higher than those with little or no engagement.</p><h4 id="Using-Video-Hashtags-3"><a href="#Using-Video-Hashtags-3" class="headerlink" title="Using Video Hashtags"></a>Using Video Hashtags</h4><p>Hashtags help people to find content that provides answers to their questions across various platforms. Use related hashtags when creating your descriptions to ensure people find your videos when searching for specific hashtags.</p><p>Tags help drive search because they make main trends more visible. After adding a hashtag to the description, it will appear above the video title, and viewers will see it hyperlinked.</p><h4 id="Categorizing-Your-Video-3"><a href="#Categorizing-Your-Video-3" class="headerlink" title="Categorizing Your Video"></a>Categorizing Your Video</h4><p>After uploading your video, you should categorize it by going to Advanced settings. By choosing a category, YouTube will group your videos with similar content. Viewers will find your quickly, as they will come in the right audience searches. In turn, this will help your videos to rank higher.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2094476/7443" target="_top" id="2094476">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2094476" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2094476/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Conclusion-3"><a href="#Conclusion-3" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>With 720,000 hours of video being uploaded every day to YouTube, getting your videos to rank high is challenging.

You can find content on just about any topic you can think of on YouTube, making it an excellent resource for entertainment and education.</p><p>But what if you’ve created a playlist of your favorite videos and think your friends or family would enjoy it? To help you with this, we’ve put together an extensive guide on <strong>how to</strong> <strong>share a YouTube playlist</strong> on your computer and mobile devices.</p><p>So, let’s get started with our guide without any further delay!</p><blockquote><p> Disclaimer: This post includes affiliate links</p><p> If you click on a link and make a purchase, I may receive a commission at no extra cost to you.</p></blockquote><h2 id="Why-Doesn’t-The-Share-Function-In-The-Playlist-Work"><a href="#Why-Doesn’t-The-Share-Function-In-The-Playlist-Work" class="headerlink" title="Why Doesn’t The Share Function In The Playlist Work?"></a>Why Doesn’t The Share Function In The Playlist Work?</h2><p>Firstly, let’s figure out why the “Share” function doesn’t work. The “Share” function in the playlist does not work because it is set to “private,” and YouTube doesn’t allow you to share them. To fix this, you must first change the privacy settings of the playlist to “public” in the following way:</p><p>Step1 Head to the <a class="link"   href="https://www.youtube.com/" >YouTube <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> website using a browser on your PC and sign in to your account.</p><p>Step2</p><ul><li><strong>Click</strong> the three-line <strong>“Menu”</strong> icon at the top-left of your screen.</li><li>Go to <strong>“Library.”</strong></li><li>Scroll down to the <strong>“Playlist”</strong> section.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/03/changing-playlist-visibility.png"                      alt="changing playlist visibility"                ></p><p>Step3 Select your playlist labeled as <strong>“Private.”</strong> On the next page, click the <strong>“Private”</strong> option in the playlist details section and select <strong>“Public”</strong> to change the visibility of your playlist.</p><p>Once the privacy setting has been changed, the <strong>“share”</strong> function will work as intended.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/03/making-youtube-playlist-public.png"                      alt="making youtube playlist public"                ></p><h2 id="How-To-Share-The-YouTube-Playlist"><a href="#How-To-Share-The-YouTube-Playlist" class="headerlink" title="How To Share The YouTube Playlist?"></a>How To Share The YouTube Playlist?</h2><p>If you want to share the playlist on YouTube using your computer or mobile device, read the instructions below carefully:</p><h3 id="1-For-Computers"><a href="#1-For-Computers" class="headerlink" title="1.

When you’re a YouTube creator, you should definitely take advantage of this desire and use a YouTube background video designed specifically with this in mind.</p><p>In this guide, we’ll go over how to get or make such a background and show you five incredible examples you can use now.</p><p><strong>YouTube Video Background</strong> Creating realistic video scenes at your will is easy to complete with Filmora green screen removal.</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Create Video Backgrounds <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Create Video Backgrounds <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Learn Green Screen <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/banner/filmora-latest-product-box.png"                      alt="Wondershare Filmora"                ></p><blockquote><p> Disclaimer: This post includes affiliate links</p><p> If you click on a link and make a purchase, I may receive a commission at no extra cost to you.</p></blockquote><h2 id="What-Is-a-YouTube-Video-Background"><a href="#What-Is-a-YouTube-Video-Background" class="headerlink" title="What Is a YouTube Video Background?"></a>What Is a YouTube Video Background?</h2><p>A <strong>YouTube video background</strong> is a simple image or video that sits in place at the back of your videos. It’s just a simple background that can greatly impact your brand, presence, and style as a creator.</p><p>Even something as small as your <strong>YouTube video thumbnail background</strong> can strongly impact your results.</p><p>Obviously, choosing the right <strong>custom YouTube background</strong> is important. And, now that it’s winter, this requires a special approach.</p><h2 id="Why-Are-Seasonal-Backgrounds-Effective"><a href="#Why-Are-Seasonal-Backgrounds-Effective" class="headerlink" title="Why Are Seasonal Backgrounds Effective?"></a>Why Are Seasonal Backgrounds Effective?</h2><p>There are several important reasons why a seasonal YouTube video background or photo, and other elements are very effective and engage us more.</p><p>The main reasons include:</p><ul><li>Creates a meaningful connection;</li><li>Boosts engagement with fellow winter lovers;</li><li>Builds a better brand;</li><li>Enhances everyone’s mood, especially during the holidays.</li></ul><p>So, whenever you can and whenever there is an opportunity, don’t be afraid to use a seasonal <strong>YouTube video background download</strong>.</p><h2 id="Factors-to-Consider-When-Choosing-a-Background-for-YouTube-Videos"><a href="#Factors-to-Consider-When-Choosing-a-Background-for-YouTube-Videos" class="headerlink" title="Factors to Consider When Choosing a Background for YouTube Videos"></a>Factors to Consider When Choosing a Background for YouTube Videos</h2><p>Now, before we dive into the examples themselves and the tutorial on how to make the best backgrounds yourself, here are several factors you must consider before proceeding.</p><h3 id="Content-Relevance"><a href="#Content-Relevance" class="headerlink" title="Content Relevance"></a>Content Relevance</h3><p>As a video creator, you must ensure to be consistent with your elements. This includes your <strong>background tune for YouTube videos.</strong> For example, if you’re talking about books in your video, including a bookshelf in the winter background makes all the difference.</p><h3 id="Audience-Appeal"><a href="#Audience-Appeal" class="headerlink" title="Audience Appeal"></a>Audience Appeal</h3><p>If you already have an audience, regardless of its size, you should definitely consider what they like and don’t like. You should then leverage this information to create highly appealing content for them and adjust your background scenery accordingly.</p><h3 id="Lighting-and-Visibility"><a href="#Lighting-and-Visibility" class="headerlink" title="Lighting and Visibility"></a>Lighting and Visibility</h3><p>Another thing you must ensure is to keep your background simple and not too distracting. Remember, even though you have the <strong>best background for YouTube videos</strong>, you still need to realize that it’s not the main focus of the video. It’s just there to make it better.</p><h3 id="Personal-Branding"><a href="#Personal-Branding" class="headerlink" title="Personal Branding"></a>Personal Branding</h3><p>If you want to improve your brand identity and get your name known by more people, incorporate your logo, name, or something similar in the background.

It’s just a simple background that can greatly impact your brand, presence, and style as a creator.</p><p>Even something as small as your <strong>YouTube video thumbnail background</strong> can strongly impact your results.</p><p>Obviously, choosing the right <strong>custom YouTube background</strong> is important.

This includes your <strong>background tune for YouTube videos.</strong> For example, if you’re talking about books in your video, including a bookshelf in the winter background makes all the difference.</p><h3 id="Audience-Appeal-1"><a href="#Audience-Appeal-1" class="headerlink" title="Audience Appeal"></a>Audience Appeal</h3><p>If you already have an audience, regardless of its size, you should definitely consider what they like and don’t like.

Remember, even though you have the <strong>best background for YouTube videos</strong>, you still need to realize that it’s not the main focus of the video. It’s just there to make it better.</p><h3 id="Personal-Branding-1"><a href="#Personal-Branding-1" class="headerlink" title="Personal Branding"></a>Personal Branding</h3><p>If you want to improve your brand identity and get your name known by more people, incorporate your logo, name, or something similar in the background.

Necessary Elements of a YouTube Sports Channel"></a>Section 1. Necessary Elements of a YouTube Sports Channel</h2><p>If you want to start a YouTube sports channel, you need to keep in mind that sports videos are fundamentally different from other types of videos. This requires you to have a strong grasp not only on content but video editing as well. Here are some of the top elements that every YouTube sports channel needs.</p><h3 id="1-Insightful-Producer-Perspective"><a href="#1-Insightful-Producer-Perspective" class="headerlink" title="1.Insightful Producer Perspective"></a>1.Insightful Producer Perspective</h3><p>First of all, you should try to have a clear and comprehensive understanding of the sport you are going to talk about on your channel. If you are just an amateur or a casual fan, you will need to do more preparation as a sports YouTuber.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/Mac-articles/sport-channel-host.jpg"                      alt="sports channel host"                ></p><h3 id="2-Brief-and-Clear-Delivery"><a href="#2-Brief-and-Clear-Delivery" class="headerlink" title="2.Brief and Clear Delivery"></a>2.Brief and Clear Delivery</h3><p>The second most important thing is to communicate your perspective in an entertaining, brief, and interactive manner so your viewers remain engaged and keep coming back to your channel. If you fail to communicate properly, your viewers will go somewhere else to watch what they are looking for.</p><h3 id="3-Advanced-Video-Editing"><a href="#3-Advanced-Video-Editing" class="headerlink" title="3.Advanced Video Editing"></a>3.Advanced Video Editing</h3><p>Apart from the content, you need to make yourself familiar with using advanced video editing features such as picture-in-picture, screen recording, and audio recording. These allow you to provide a high-quality viewing experience to your YouTube channel audience.</p><h3 id="4-Branded-Intro-Outro"><a href="#4-Branded-Intro-Outro" class="headerlink" title="4.Branded Intro &amp; Outro"></a>4.Branded Intro &amp; Outro</h3><p>You need to set yourself apart with the impactful branding of your sports YouTube channel. It means that the software you are using on your Mac needs to have smart editing features including the ability to add cool intros and outros that become the trademark of your sports channel.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/Mac-articles/sport-intro.jpg"                      alt="sport intro"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2082527/7443" target="_top" id="2082527">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2082527" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2082527/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p>You May Also Like:</p><ul><li><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >YouTuber Skillshare: Essential Video Cutting Skills For YouTubers&gt;&gt;&gt; <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></li><li><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >What is the Best MP4 Cutter for YouTubers On Mac?&gt;&gt;&gt; <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></li></ul><h2 id="Section-2-Must-Use-Feature-for-Making-a-Sports-YouTube-Channel"><a href="#Section-2-Must-Use-Feature-for-Making-a-Sports-YouTube-Channel" class="headerlink" title="Section 2. Must Use Feature for Making a Sports YouTube Channel"></a>Section 2. Must Use Feature for Making a Sports YouTube Channel</h2><p>There are many features that you may need in your sports content creation. High video quality will bring more views and attract more fans to your YouTube channel. Here are some features you may use in making sports videos.</p><h3 id="1-Making-a-Sports-YouTube-Channel-Screen-Recording"><a href="#1-Making-a-Sports-YouTube-Channel-Screen-Recording" class="headerlink" title="1. Making a Sports YouTube Channel - Screen Recording"></a>1. Making a Sports YouTube Channel - Screen Recording</h3><p>One of the top features that you must use in your sports content creation is screen recording. It is a vital feature for all sports YouTubers and it is used extensively for multiple reasons:</p><ul><li>It gives content creators the ability to give demonstrations in a clear and convenient manner that is easily understandable.</li><li>Screen recording also allows them to create how-to and tutorial videos for games and other sports.</li><li>They can also use this feature to record a video clip that may not be easy to include in the final video.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/Mac-articles/youtube.jpg"                      alt="youtube"                ></p><p>This feature will give your audience the opportunity to understand your point clearly without having to visualize everything in their heads. Everything you say would be right in front of them in the form of screen recording and they can easily get your perspective.</p><h3 id="2-Making-a-Sports-YouTube-Channel-Picture-in-Picture"><a href="#2-Making-a-Sports-YouTube-Channel-Picture-in-Picture" class="headerlink" title="2. Making a Sports YouTube Channel- Picture in Picture"></a>2. Making a Sports YouTube Channel- Picture in Picture</h3><p>Another key feature that is widely used by YouTube sports channels is picture-in-picture, especially those who engage in live commentary while the game or match is still being played. As a Mac YouTube channel producer, you must use this feature to gain the following advantages:</p><ul><li>Picture in Picture allows you to stay visible to your audience while commentating or giving your opinion on a game.</li><li>It also provides you with the ability to divert more focus on the game so the bigger part of the screen is dedicated to sports.</li><li>You can also switch between the smaller and bigger video sections when necessary, for example during a break or interval.</li><li>It gives you the opportunity to make your YouTube channel more personalized with your own take on picture-in-picture.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/Mac-articles/pip.jpg"                      alt="pip"                ></p><p>Picture in picture is a great feature for sports YouTubers on Mac as it keeps the video entertaining and personalized. Without using a picture-in-picture feature, you will find it difficult to compete with other sports YouTube channels.</p><h3 id="3-Making-a-Sports-YouTube-Channel-Audio-Recording"><a href="#3-Making-a-Sports-YouTube-Channel-Audio-Recording" class="headerlink" title="3. Making a Sports YouTube Channel - Audio Recording"></a>3. Making a Sports YouTube Channel - Audio Recording</h3><p>There are times when you cannot use the native audio of the sports video and need to add your own. It means that you need to record your own audio file and add it to the video before uploading it to your YouTube channel. This feature allows you to:</p><ul><li>Edit the audio of your sports video to make it more customizable according to your target audience.</li><li>Remove the audio that might cause copyright issues and add your own to ensure your content remains original.</li><li>Add your own remarks, commentary, and opinions in the video in full or in parts to make it more engaging and interactive.</li><li>Make videos where you just need background music and don’t need the original audio such as montages, tributes, etc.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/filmora-mac-record-voiceover.jpg"                      alt="voiceover"                ></p><p><a href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-win.jpg"                      alt="Download Win Version"                ></a><a href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-mac.jpg"                      alt="Download Mac Version"                ></a></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://imp.i110150.net/c/5597632/924297/11305" target="_top" id="924297">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/11305-924297" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.i110150.net/i/5597632/924297/11305"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p>Clear and crisp audio recording is necessary to ensure that the video you upload on your sports YouTube channel is of high quality.

It can be extremely discouraging at first. More experienced vloggers know that mistakes happen and they are no reason to stop recording. Instead of trying to record a perfect clip it is common for vloggers to remove errors from their videos in editing using jump cuts.</p><h2 id="How-To-Use-Jump-Cuts-in-Your-Vlog-1"><a href="#How-To-Use-Jump-Cuts-in-Your-Vlog-1" class="headerlink" title="How To Use Jump Cuts in Your Vlog"></a>How To Use Jump Cuts in Your Vlog</h2><h4 id="1-What-is-a-Jump-Cut"><a href="#1-What-is-a-Jump-Cut" class="headerlink" title="1. What is a Jump Cut?"></a>1. What is a Jump Cut?</h4><p>A jump cut is when you jump from one part of your clip to a later part of that same clip, cutting out the section in-between.</p><p>In movies or tv shows jump cuts can be distracting. In vlogs it is the exact opposite; jump cuts are used to remove distractions. It is not strange for a YouTube video to contain a lot of jump cuts. If you go and re-watch a video by your favorite vlogger you will probably notice that every once in a while the vlogger is suddenly sitting differently or that something else has suddenly changed. That is a jump cut, and chances are you did not even think twice about it when you first watched the video.</p><h4 id="2-When-to-use-Jump-Cuts-in-your-Youtube-Video"><a href="#2-When-to-use-Jump-Cuts-in-your-Youtube-Video" class="headerlink" title="2. When to use Jump Cuts in your Youtube Video"></a>2. When to use Jump Cuts in your Youtube Video</h4><p>There are a lot of things you might want to take out of your clips using jump cuts. Here are some examples:</p><p><strong>Repetition</strong>: You may have had to repeat yourself because you misspoke. Or, you might watch your clip back and realize that two sections you intended – perhaps even scripted – are very similar and you only need one.</p><p><strong>Off-Topic Tangents</strong>: Once you get comfortable talking to the camera it is easy to find yourself getting off-topic while recording. These tangents might be funny or feel important, but you should still cut them out of your final video. Rather than scrapping them completely, though, consider giving your tangent its very own video. Successful vloggers post new videos frequently, after all.</p><p><strong>Silence</strong>: Use jump cuts to take out any pauses in your video. Every period of silence is an opportunity for viewers to get distracted and decide to click on something else. Adding music to the background of your video can help with shorter pauses, but cutting out any silence is still a good way to go.</p><p>In the video tutorial below, we will share with you some practical and creative jump cuts tips that you can try in video editing. And most of the jump cuts are done with the cutting features in <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Filmora <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.

How to Make Jump Cuts in Vlog &amp; YouTube Videos"></a>3. How to Make Jump Cuts in Vlog &amp; YouTube Videos</h4><p>You can make jump cuts in almost every editing program, from free software like Windows Movie Maker to professional programs like Adobe Premiere. Remember no matter which video editing software you are using to edit your videos with jump cut, you need to ensure that the software can scroll through your video clips and audio files frame-by-frame. And some video editors may only allow you to scroll video footage frame by frame. This tutorial is for Filmora Video Editor (Now upgraded to Filmora), but many of the same steps will apply to other software.</p><p><a href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-win.jpg"                      alt="Download Win Version"                ></a><a class="link"   href="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-mac.jpg" >Download Mac Version <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>](<a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/ <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>)</p><p>You may also like: <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >How to trim and cut videos in Windows Movie Maker for Free <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>Open up Filmora Video Editor and add a clip into the timeline. Watch it through, and then revisit sections where you think you might want to make cuts.</p><p>Find a place in your clip that has silence and use the scissors icon to cut your clip into two. Then start playing your clip and pause as soon as you hear sound.</p><p>Make sure your clip is selected, and then go back frame by frame until you hear nothing.</p><p>Use the scissors icon to make another cut. You will now have three clips; one before the silence, the silent pause, and the section where sound starts again. Delete the quiet middle clip.</p><h4 id="4-Keep-video-shorter-for-more-views"><a href="#4-Keep-video-shorter-for-more-views" class="headerlink" title="4. Keep video shorter for more views"></a>4. Keep video shorter for more views</h4><p>The videos that get the most views on YouTube are an average of three minutes long. People will use the length of a video as a reason not to click on it. Viewers are also more likely to get distracted and stop watching longer videos before they are over. That does not mean you should not take as long as you need to properly explain your ideas, just that you should be careful your video is not longer than it needs to be. It is common for youtubers to use only about a third of the clip they record. The rest is removed using jump cuts.</p><p>Filmora video editor will help you to be more creative in video editing and saving your time at the same time.

Along with all this massive inflow, there are scenarios where the video content that you like or wanted to watch gets deleted for any reason. Either the uploading channel deleted the video, or YouTube sometimes deletes videos for violating any of the platform’s rules – showing the dismal message “We’re sorry, this video is no longer available”. You’ll be thinking it is probably impossible to access deleted YouTube videos that you wanted to watch so badly. Though it may be true to some extent, in reality, nothing gets deleted from the internet. To help you watch deleted YouTube videos, we’ll dive into the two most handy methods down below. So, let get started.</p><p>You might be interested in <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >How to Make a Playlist of Uploaded Videos and Others’ Video on YouTube&gt;&gt;&gt; <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><ul><li><a href="#part1"><strong>Part 1: Watch Deleted YouTube Videos with a URL</strong></a></li><li><a href="#part2"><strong>Part 2: Watch Deleted YouTube Videos without a URL</strong></a></li><li><a href="#part3"><strong>Part 3: Bonus Tip—Make Your Own YouTube Video with Wondershare FilmoraX</strong></a></li></ul><h2 id=""><a href="#" class="headerlink" title="["></a>[<img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-win.jpg"                      alt="Download Win Version"                ></h2><h2 id="Part-1-Watch-Deleted-YouTube-Videos-with-a-URL"><a href="#Part-1-Watch-Deleted-YouTube-Videos-with-a-URL" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: Watch Deleted YouTube Videos with a URL"></a>Part 1: Watch Deleted YouTube Videos with a URL</h2><p>Internet Archive(known as the Wayback Machine) is a website archival system that has been collecting and cataloging websites since 1996. This means the system has effectively saved the site’s current layout and data. This enormous world archive of the Web’s past has amassed over 100 terabytes of storage with around 10 billion web pages.</p><p>On the archive.org website, you can find many of your favorite web site’s “snapshot” at a time in the past. For our case, we need to find and watch deleted YouTube videos, so for that, all we need is the link of the video, and we can most probably find it on archive.org. The steps for finding and restoring deleted YouTube videos are simple and as follows.</p><p>1. First of all, find the URL in your YouTube email, channel account if you’re searching for your uploaded video. You can find the link in browser history, in YouTube history, or you may have shared the link on social media.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/find-video-from-youtube-history.jpg"                      alt="Find deleted YouTube videos from history"                ></p><p>If you want to watch a deleted YouTube video using the Wayback Machine, you must find the link to the video you want to access; without the URL, you won’t be able to access the deleted YouTube video.</p><p>2. Head over to the <a class="link"   href="https://archive.org/" >archive.org website <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> and paste the YouTube video URL in the search bar and press return.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/open-way-back-machine1.jpg"                      alt="open way back machine"                ></p><p>3. Once you find your video on the internet archive, you can see the details of the video.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/find-deleted-video2.jpg"                      alt="find deleted video"                ></p><p>4. You won’t be able to play the video directly, but you should be able to download it. Right, click the video to find the option to download the video.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/download-deleted-video3.jpg"                      alt="download deleted video"                ></p><p>This method works mostly as the Wayback machine is pretty active and regularly crawls the web to archive the sites. But sometimes, this method may not work and would require a more sophisticated way to watch deleted YouTube videos.</p><h2 id="-1"><a href="#-1" class="headerlink" title="["></a>[<img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-win.jpg"                      alt="Download Win Version"                ></h2><h2 id="Part-2-Watch-Deleted-YouTube-Videos-without-a-URL"><a href="#Part-2-Watch-Deleted-YouTube-Videos-without-a-URL" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: Watch Deleted YouTube Videos without a URL"></a>Part 2: Watch Deleted YouTube Videos without a URL</h2><p>But what if you don’t have a URL for the deleted YouTube video? The internet is a global village network. Everything on the internet is connected, and that connection makes it more useful for example, even though a YouTube video might be deleted, you can somehow access and watch the deleted YouTube videos without a URL because people always replicate videos and share them on other YouTube channels or social media platforms. To make sure you get to watch your favorite YouTube video again, we will dive into the vast internet and find the deleted YouTube videos.</p><p>This method can be a bit complicated and would require you to give full attention to find the video you want to watch that badly that you’ve landed on this article.</p><p>1. Open a new tab in your browser and go to the Google search bar. We’re going to employ a technique from the SEO expert’s toolbox – Google Search Operators.</p><p>2. In the search bar, type <strong>“site:<a class="link"   href="http://www.youtube.com/" >www.youtube.com <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> + name Of TheVideo”</strong></p><p>3. This way Google will crawl all the name relevant videos only from the YouTube databases and move us closer to finding our deleted YouTube video.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/goggle-crawl-url4.jpg"                      alt="google crawl url"                ></p><p>4. If you know the video was shared by someone on Facebook or any other social media platform, you can change the site URL in the search bar, replacing YouTube with Facebook, for example.</p><p>5. Once you find the video URL, you can simply go back to the first method that we discussed and paste the URL into the internet archive. The archive will give you the video and you can enjoy watching a deleted YouTube video.</p><p>Note: If you still cannot find the video using this method, I’m sorry to tell you the video may be completely deleted from the server, and you cannot access it anymore.</p><h2 id="Part-3-Bonus-Tip—Make-Your-Own-YouTube-Video-with-Wondershare-Filmora"><a href="#Part-3-Bonus-Tip—Make-Your-Own-YouTube-Video-with-Wondershare-Filmora" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: Bonus Tip—Make Your Own YouTube Video with Wondershare Filmora"></a>Part 3: Bonus Tip—Make Your Own YouTube Video with Wondershare Filmora</h2><p>Want to make a YouTube video again? <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Wondershare Filmora <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> is a relatively lightweight and powerful platform you get an intuitive interface and the power to create wonderful, unique content.

It’s hard to crack the top search engine rankings as a small channel. Many people on YouTube would probably love their content, but all of those views are going to already popular channels.</p><p>Many YouTubers look for alternative ways to get views for their videos, not to replace organic views, but to better position their videos to be seen by real viewers. Buying views or signing up for a view exchange platform are two methods some YouTubers consider, and another is bots.</p><p><strong>View exchange platforms are allowed, and buying views is grey, but bots are against the rules. Warning:</strong> be aware that increasing your view count with a bot is against YouTube’s Terms of Service and that if you get caught, your video will be taken down. If you still wish to learn more about bots, keep reading.

Bots automatically add views to your videos.</p><p>Setting up a bot can be as easy as using other pieces of software, and there are lots of free tutorials on YouTube for view bots.</p><h2 id="Why-Use-a-YouTube-View-Bot"><a href="#Why-Use-a-YouTube-View-Bot" class="headerlink" title="Why Use a YouTube View Bot?"></a>Why Use a YouTube View Bot?</h2><p>Bots are used to create the illusion that a video is already popular to attract real viewers who view the existing view count as ‘social proof’ of the video’s quality. The main benefit is that it is fast, easy, and usually free. There are other ways, besides bots, bot accomplishes this, but if a YouTuber is resorting to a bot, it probably means they don’t have the money to buy real human views or the time to participate in a view exchange platform.</p><p>Bots can also be used to generate comments and likes for videos.</p><h2 id="What-Else-Can-A-YouTube-View-Bot-Do"><a href="#What-Else-Can-A-YouTube-View-Bot-Do" class="headerlink" title="What Else Can A YouTube View Bot Do?"></a>What Else Can A YouTube View Bot Do?</h2><p>The most effective bots come with more features than bypassing Captchas and generating views.</p><p>You can set up a YouTube bot to perform daily tasks and automate your workflow. An example might be ensuring that every video on your page gets a view and comment every day. You can also use bots (or content organization platforms) to share your videos across social media automatically. This frees you up to focus on creating quality content.</p><p>Using a bot to increase your views artificially has its dangers, but it also has the potential to kick start the organic growth of your channel. Once you start attracting real viewers and subscribers, you will not need to keep relying on a bot.</p><h2 id="Are-There-Risks-to-Using-A-YouTube-View-Bot"><a href="#Are-There-Risks-to-Using-A-YouTube-View-Bot" class="headerlink" title="Are There Risks to Using A YouTube View Bot?"></a>Are There Risks to Using A YouTube View Bot?</h2><p> <strong>Yes.</strong></p><p>Bots are against YouTube’s TOS, especially for partners using AdSense (<a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >learn more about YouTube’s partnership program here <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>). Suppose you are suspected of using a bot. In that case, your videos can get taken down, and you could lose the ability to monetize content (YouTube reviews channels now before they can monetize, and it will be obvious to them if you’ve used a bot to get to the 10,000 lifetime views you need for monetization). Repeated offenses could even get you banned from YouTube, and it is much easier to lose AdSense access.</p><p>The biggest danger isn’t YouTube taking your videos down, though. So long as you don’t persist after being warned, you can always recover. No, the real danger of bots is that they generate low retention views. Essentially, the views you get from a bot appear to YouTube’s algorithm as if people have clicked on your videos but haven’t watched them. The algorithm interprets that as ‘the people clicking on this don’t like it, we should rank it lower down in search results. Rather than attracting organic views, bots can make it very difficult for a real viewer to find your content.</p><p>If you are going to use a bot, you need to use it smartly and sparingly to prevent damage to your channel.</p><h2 id="Alternatives-to-Using-View-Bots-to-Increase-YouTube-Views"><a href="#Alternatives-to-Using-View-Bots-to-Increase-YouTube-Views" class="headerlink" title="Alternatives to Using View Bots to Increase YouTube Views"></a>Alternatives to Using View Bots to Increase YouTube Views</h2><h3 id="1-Organically-Growing-Your-Channel"><a href="#1-Organically-Growing-Your-Channel" class="headerlink" title="1.

To be viewed by numerous followers and potential subscribers. For this, you need to run your channels tactfully. There are days when people throng the social media to watch upcoming content and videos. Perhaps you can make your best bets on such days. And is there any best day to post YouTube video?</p><p>Probably yes! People will settle on social media sites when they are more relaxed and off heavy duties on the weekdays. Let’s now dive into posting your videos and attaining some good leads.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/best-days-to-post-youtube-1.png"                      alt="best days to post on youtube"                ></p><h4 id="In-this-article"><a href="#In-this-article" class="headerlink" title="In this article"></a>In this article</h4><p>01 <a href="#part1">Why is it important to post your YouTube video on the best days?</a></p><p>02 <a href="#part2">Best Days to Post on YouTube - General Practices</a></p><p>03 <a href="#part3">Best Days to Post on YouTube - Individual channel</a></p><h2 id="Why-is-it-important-to-post-your-YouTube-video-on-the-best-days"><a href="#Why-is-it-important-to-post-your-YouTube-video-on-the-best-days" class="headerlink" title="Why is it important to post your YouTube video on the best days?"></a>Why is it important to post your YouTube video on the best days?</h2><p>You are better off with best days to post on YouTube to increase the chances of getting more views.

You won’t need a lot of time to invest in expensive equipment. Remember, when viewers see your content immediately, they are posted, there are high chances of them sharing along with friends.</p><h4 id="2-You’ll-grow-your-audience-worldwide"><a href="#2-You’ll-grow-your-audience-worldwide" class="headerlink" title="2) You’ll grow your audience worldwide"></a>2) You’ll grow your audience worldwide</h4><p>Growing a worldwide audience is every content creator’s dream. Posting your videos on the best days will open doors to new visitors who perhaps haven’t heard about you. It is even better to include captions so that people of all walks get your message deeply.</p><h4 id="3-You’ll-appear-more-on-Google-searches"><a href="#3-You’ll-appear-more-on-Google-searches" class="headerlink" title="3) You’ll appear more on Google searches"></a>3) You’ll appear more on Google searches</h4><p>Posting at the right time will help Google identify your content and make it appear on Google searches. Google uses an algorithm to check on many concepts of video posting. It means that posting your videos to YouTube on the best days will spike the graph and automatically get noticed by Google.</p><h4 id="4-Your-audience-will-promote-you"><a href="#4-Your-audience-will-promote-you" class="headerlink" title="4) Your audience will promote you"></a>4) Your audience will promote you</h4><p>Remember, when viewers go on searches, they look for something important to them.

If your content is about kid’s stuff and other online learning skills, then pushing it just before the weekend could give you some good visits. Kids tend to have various activities over the weekend and so, the best time for them to embark on online learning is just before the weekend kicks off.</p><h4 id="Weekends"><a href="#Weekends" class="headerlink" title="- Weekends"></a>- Weekends</h4><p>Weekends will suit content that needs to sell products to the middle-class. Since they are busy the whole week with other duties, they probably find time over the weekend to chill and check out what’s happening around them and the world at large.</p><h4 id="End-year"><a href="#End-year" class="headerlink" title="- End year"></a>- End year</h4><p>When it comes to the best months to post on YouTube, the end-year period tends to be the best. Usually, this is when companies and individuals are winding up on their busy schedules of the year. They want to get improvements and tips to start the next year. It is wise to spend more time online, giving the necessary tips and probably hooking up some potential customers.</p><h2 id="Best-Days-to-Post-on-YouTube-Individual-channel"><a href="#Best-Days-to-Post-on-YouTube-Individual-channel" class="headerlink" title="Best Days to Post on YouTube - Individual channel"></a>Best Days to Post on YouTube - Individual channel</h2><p>Stop guessing and find the facts right.

This means that the camera cannot be too far back from you while you vlog.</p><h4 id="3-Audio-Technica-AT875R-Line-Gradient-Condenser-Microphone-240"><a href="#3-Audio-Technica-AT875R-Line-Gradient-Condenser-Microphone-240" class="headerlink" title="3.

This gradient condenser mic is good at picking up sound at a distance, and at only picking up sound coming from directly in front of it. If you are working alone then you can set this mic up on a stand so it is pointing at you, or if you have a friend to help you you can ask them to hold it on a boom pole.</p><h4 id="4-Sony-LAV-Wireless-Mic-System-600"><a href="#4-Sony-LAV-Wireless-Mic-System-600" class="headerlink" title="4.

Wearing a LAV Mic while you vlog will allow you to move around freely and still capture great audio, rather than being stuck in range of a stationary mic. There are both wired and wireless options available in LAV Mics.</p><h4 id="5-Roland-R-05-WAVE-MP3-Recorder-200"><a href="#5-Roland-R-05-WAVE-MP3-Recorder-200" class="headerlink" title="5.

Your viewers can forgive your grainy video footage, poor lighting, and unsteady camera handling, but if your audio sounds like you’re speaking across the road on a busy highway, all your hard work will be wasted, because nobody will want to watch it.</p><p>But the thing about microphones is that they are not all created equal.

Connecting directly to your computer via USB, the Blue Yeti comes with a 6-feet long USB cable. Out of the box, it sits upon a sturdy stand, which can be removed and the mic can be threaded a shock mount.</p><p>The Blue Yeti can pick up audio in four different polar patterns: cardioid, bidirectional, omnidirectional, and stereo. This makes it incredibly versatile, but if you are streaming, I recommend keeping it on cardioid.</p><p>Tip: In cardioid mode, speak into the front of the mic, not the top of it.</p><h3 id="2-Best-Microphones-for-Outdoor-Locations"><a href="#2-Best-Microphones-for-Outdoor-Locations" class="headerlink" title="2.

Shotgun microphones, such as the Rode VideoMic Pro, picks up audio only in the direction it’s pointing in. You can aim it at your subject and it will give you clear audio without a lot of background noises.</p><p>The Rode VideoMic Pro comes with a mount that attaches on top of your camera, if you are filming outdoors. So if you are holding the camera and vlogging, then the audio will be great. However, if you want to take advantage of the space, and set the camera further away, you should attach the mic on a boom or a stand to get the best audio.</p><p>Tip: With Rode VideoMic Pro, and any mic you use to shoot outdoors, always do a sound check to make sure the quality is up to standard. Ten seconds of your subject talking at the level they will be speaking in will be enough to judge the sound quality.</p><h3 id="3-Best-Microphone-for-Music-Vocals"><a href="#3-Best-Microphone-for-Music-Vocals" class="headerlink" title="3.

Even if you’re recording in your bedroom, and not a professional studio, you’ll still get high quality vocals from this microphone.</p><p><strong>Tip</strong> : Position yourself 8-12 inches away from the mic when singing. This allows your voice to sound more natural (too close and it’ll sound bassy) and it prevents the audio volume from fluctuating too dramatically as you move around or sing loudly one part and quietly at another.</p><h3 id="4-Best-Microphone-for-Voice-Over"><a href="#4-Best-Microphone-for-Voice-Over" class="headerlink" title="4.

If that’s the case, film the source of the background noise. Get b-roll of people walking around, machinery operating, or whatever challenging sound you are dealing with in the large space. Cutting to these noise makers will give the audience a reference for the background noise, which helps conceal it.</p><h3 id="6-Best-Handheld-Microphone-for-Interviews"><a href="#6-Best-Handheld-Microphone-for-Interviews" class="headerlink" title="6.

Here are a few more:</p><ul><li>You get to help your viewers by providing them with both factual information, and the opinion of someone they trust (you!).</li><li>Your reviews can help people save money! By watching your videos, viewers will be able to make informed buying decisions.</li><li>Your reviews can help YOU save money!

The product should be related to a topic you know a lot about. This will make your review more credible. It is easier to grow your channel if you focus on a niche (i.e. camera equipment or makeup) you are particularly knowledgeable about.</p><ul><li><a href="#affiliatelinks">Affiliate Links</a></li><li><a href="#freeproducts">Getting Products for Free</a></li><li><a href="#filming">Filming the Video</a></li></ul><h3 id="Part-1-Get-Paid-by-Reviewing-Product-with-Affiliate-Links"><a href="#Part-1-Get-Paid-by-Reviewing-Product-with-Affiliate-Links" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: Get Paid by Reviewing Product with Affiliate Links"></a>Part 1: Get Paid by Reviewing Product with Affiliate Links</h3><p>One of the main ways you can make money doing reviews is through affiliate links. When you join the affiliate program of an online store they will allow you to create special links, called affiliate links, to products listed there. You post these affiliate links in the descriptions of your video reviews and, if viewers choose to click on those links and buy the products, you will earn a sales commission. Here are some stores with great affiliate programs:</p><h4 id="1-JVZoo"><a href="#1-JVZoo" class="headerlink" title="1. JVZoo"></a>1. JVZoo</h4><p>You can find high end products for about $5 to $10. Budgeting will be important if you plan on purchasing products to review instead of only reviewing products you already own (you should try to review items you already have as much as possible).</p><h4 id="2-Click-Bank"><a href="#2-Click-Bank" class="headerlink" title="2. Click Bank"></a>2. Click Bank</h4><p>You can find a wide range of interesting products here, and you can earn as much as 75% on sales commissions if you provide your viewers with an affiliate link.</p><h4 id="3-Warrior-Plus"><a href="#3-Warrior-Plus" class="headerlink" title="3. Warrior Plus"></a>3. Warrior Plus</h4><p>This is a highly renowned affiliate program. It very similar to JVZoo.</p><h4 id="4-Amazon"><a href="#4-Amazon" class="headerlink" title="4. Amazon"></a>4. Amazon</h4><p>It doesn’t get any better than Amazon. You can find just about anything.</p><h3 id="Part-2-Getting-Products-for-Free"><a href="#Part-2-Getting-Products-for-Free" class="headerlink" title="Part 2:  Getting Products for Free"></a>Part 2:  Getting Products for Free</h3><p>Once you’ve built up authority as a reviewer, brands will start giving you free stuff to review. Until then, you can buy the products yourself or review products which you already own. It will be a lot cheaper to review things you already have, or which you were already planning to buy, than to buy products for the purpose of reviewing them. Your reviews will also be more detailed and useful when they are on products you are especially familiar with.</p><p>Once you start building a following, brands will come to you and it will be your choice whether you want to review the things they send you. Until then, try to promote&#x2F;review products you already have opinions on.</p><h3 id="Part-3-Filming-the-Video"><a href="#Part-3-Filming-the-Video" class="headerlink" title="Part 3:  Filming the Video"></a>Part 3:  Filming the Video</h3><p>Be completely honest. People are going to know when you are trying to sell something. Fake reviewers are all over the place, and they are easily spotted.</p><p>That does not mean you shouldn’t make money through affiliate links, or accept free products to review. So long as you are honest in your opinions, and open with your viewers about any relationships you have with brands, you are not ‘selling out’.</p><p><strong>Bottom Line</strong></p><p>It takes time to earn any money reviewing products on YouTube. However, once you are an established authority in your niche, brands might start coming to you on their own.</p><p>If you were going to be paid to review products on YouTube, what kinds of products would they be? And if you want to make the reviewing video better, you should use a video editing software like <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Filmora <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> .</p><p><a href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-win.jpg"                      alt="Download Filmora9 Win Version"                > </a> <a href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-mac.jpg"                      alt="Download Filmora9 Mac Version"                > </a></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/richard-bennett.jpg"                      alt="author avatar"                ></p><p>Richard Bennett</p><p>Richard Bennett is a writer and a lover of all things video.</p><p>Follow @Richard Bennett</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://youtube-tips.techidaily.com/ed-most-popular-free-photography-and-film-archives-for-2024/"><u>[Updated] Most Popular Free Photography and Film Archives for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-tips.techidaily.com/ed-editmaster-suite-for-2024/"><u>[Updated] EditMaster Suite for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-tips.techidaily.com/ed-streamline-video-analytics-a-guide-to-youtube-statistics-with-social-blade-for-2024/"><u>[Updated] Streamline Video Analytics  A Guide to YouTube Statistics with Social Blade for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-tips.techidaily.com/024-approved-youtubes-glamour-guild-comprehensive-style-compendium/"><u>[New] 2024 Approved  Youtube's Glamour Guild  Comprehensive Style Compendium</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-tips.techidaily.com/ting-your-gameplay-on-youtube-with-these-essential-tags-for-2024/"><u>Elevating Your Gameplay on YouTube with These Essential Tags for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-tips.techidaily.com/ersonalizing-public-vs-private-settings-on-youtube/"><u>[New] Personalizing Public vs Private Settings on YouTube</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-tips.techidaily.com/ed-simplifying-social-media-your-guide-to-facebook-youtube-syncing-for-2024/"><u>[Updated] Simplifying Social Media  Your Guide to Facebook-YouTube Syncing for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-tips.techidaily.com/ed-leaders-engineering-digital-marvel-realms-for-2024/"><u>[Updated] Leaders Engineering Digital Marvel Realms for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://instagram-video-recordings.techidaily.com/updated-rotate-for-results-instagram-video-alchemy-for-2024/"><u>[Updated] Rotate for Results  Instagram Video Alchemy for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://desktop-recording.techidaily.com/new-2024-approved-premier-productions-first-impression/"><u>[New] 2024 Approved  Premier Productions First Impression</u></a></li><li><a href="https://visual-screen-recording.techidaily.com/new-unlocking-freenocams-webcam-capturing-capabilities-for-2024/"><u>[New] Unlocking FreenoCam's Webcam Capturing Capabilities for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://howto.techidaily.com/proven-ways-to-fix-there-was-a-problem-parsing-the-package-on-samsung-galaxy-a54-5g-drfone-by-drfone-fix-android-problems-fix-android-problems/"><u>Proven Ways to Fix There Was A Problem Parsing the Package on Samsung Galaxy A54 5G | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://ai-editing-video.techidaily.com/2024-approved-how-to-create-obs-slideshow/"><u>2024 Approved How to Create OBS Slideshow</u></a></li><li><a href="https://android-pokemon-go.techidaily.com/ipogo-will-be-the-new-ispoofer-on-lava-yuva-2-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/"><u>iPogo will be the new iSpoofer On Lava Yuva 2?

All of the tags on the site will be displayed, and the most commonly used ones will be biggest. The tags include what the sounds are meant to be (i.e. percussion or thunder) and what type of sounds they are (i.e. field-recording or synth).</p><h4 id="3-PacDV"><a href="#3-PacDV" class="headerlink" title="3.

The categories are:</p><p> <strong>Ambience:</strong>  this is where you’ll find general background sounds, like ‘car interior’ or ‘grocery store’. Even when nothing in particular is happening, locations have sounds. This is also where you’ll find things like crowd noises.</p><p> <strong>Domestic:</strong>  these are sounds you hear around the home, like sounds related to doors and appliances.</p><p> <strong>Interfaces:</strong>  a lot of tech sounds live here, like beeps and clicks. Beeps are all titled ‘Beep’, but nothing else is really labeled beyond being called ‘Interface Sound’. You just have to listen and find out.</p><p> <strong>Machines:</strong>  a variety of different machine sounds can be found here, from power tools like chainsaws and drills to things like typewriters or paper shredders.</p><p> <strong>Mechanical:</strong>  this is where you’ll find sounds associated with cameras, coin slots, zippers, and more.</p><p> <strong>People:</strong>  laughing, clapping, footsteps and even farts – this is where you’ll find human sounds.</p><p> <strong>Transportation:</strong>  these sounds are all related to vehicles, be they cars or airplanes.</p><p> <strong>Voices:</strong>  here you’ll find voices saying common things like ‘hi’, ‘aaah’, or ‘come on’.</p><p> <strong>Music:</strong>  PacDV also has a selection of royalty free music.

It is not uncommon for older folk to enjoy this type of content, especially if they want to unwind after a long day. However, the industry is becoming pretty crowded, making it harder for content creators to stand out from the crowd.</p><p>An excellent way to get your target audience to notice you would be to design a killer YouTube banner that will immediately cause anyone scrolling past to click on your video. Stick around to learn how to create a great gaming YouTube banner with templates.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/gaming-youtube-banner-template.gif"                      alt="pholody interface"                ></p><h2 id="Importance-of-a-Banner-for-Your-YouTube-Gaming-Channel"><a href="#Importance-of-a-Banner-for-Your-YouTube-Gaming-Channel" class="headerlink" title="Importance of a Banner for Your YouTube Gaming Channel"></a>Importance of a Banner for Your YouTube Gaming Channel</h2><p>Imagine a scenario where you want to open a brick-and-mortar store. One of the most important things you need to get out of the way is the business name. Once you have settled on a fitting name, you will then move on to create a sign to place outside your shop.</p><p>For example, a banner for your YouTube gaming channel plays a similar role to signage for a brick-and-mortar shop.</p><ul><li>An excellent banner helps you make a solid first impression on your viewers, some of who is viewing your content for the first time.</li><li>Secondly, a well-designed banner reflects positively on your brand and helps you grow your audience at a steady rate.</li><li>Thirdly, you can use your banner to give your viewers a rough idea of what your video is about without them clicking to watch. A suitable banner can cause anticipation to build within your viewers. Once the video is over, they won’t resist visiting your channel to see what else you offer.</li></ul><h2 id="Guide-to-YouTube-Gaming-Banner-Size"><a href="#Guide-to-YouTube-Gaming-Banner-Size" class="headerlink" title="Guide to YouTube Gaming Banner Size"></a>Guide to YouTube Gaming Banner Size</h2><p>We can liken a banner for your YouTube video to a book cover to a novel you have been dying to read. Therefore, it would be wise to get the size right if you want to create an excellent first impression for yourself. Ideally, the best size for a YouTube banner is 2560*1440 pixels or an aspect ratio of 16:9.</p><p>We urge you not to upload a banner smaller than 2048*1152 pixels, or else the image will appear cropped. Keep your banner within 1235*338 pixels and centered on the screen to be on the safe side.</p><p>This YouTube banner dimension is ideal for viewing on any device since your audience might use their smartphones or laptop to watch your videos on YouTube. Lastly, ensure you keep the file to a maximum of 6MB. We believe this file size is pretty generous.</p><h2 id="Tips-for-Designing-an-Attractive-Gaming-YouTube-Banner"><a href="#Tips-for-Designing-an-Attractive-Gaming-YouTube-Banner" class="headerlink" title="Tips for Designing an Attractive Gaming YouTube Banner"></a>Tips for Designing an Attractive Gaming YouTube Banner</h2><p>Below are some tips that will help you create beautiful YouTube banners.</p><p>Simplicity is key: Contrary to popular belief, a simple banner looks more polished than a complex one. If your YouTube banner has too many elements, your viewers using their mobile phones might have a challenge viewing the image.</p><p>Ensure the graphics are high-quality : Nothing is as frustrating to your viewers as seeing a blurry or pixelated YouTube banner. However, high-quality graphics with a resolution of at least 1920*1080 pixels make your work look polished and attract more viewers to your channel.</p><p>Leverage the grid system: Some of your viewers might watch your videos from their smartphones, and others on their laptops or tablets. The grid system allows you to ensure the full banner will be visible no matter what device your audience will use to watch your gaming videos.</p><p>Add a CTA: At the end of the day, you are trying to grow your audience on your YouTube channel. You might also have other social media platforms where you post content. Since your banner is one of the first things your audience will see, you could include a short, easy-to-read, and understandable call to action. For instance, you could encourage them to “Subscribe Now!”</p><p>Incorporate your unique color scheme: By now, you already have a theme for your YouTube channel that your existing subscribers associate with you. As you design your YouTube banner, ensure you incorporate your theme colors, so new visitors know what colors to look out for as they scroll on the platform.</p><h2 id="Why-Use-Templates-To-Create-Gaming-YouTube-Banners"><a href="#Why-Use-Templates-To-Create-Gaming-YouTube-Banners" class="headerlink" title="Why Use Templates To Create Gaming YouTube Banners?"></a>Why Use Templates To Create Gaming YouTube Banners?</h2><p>First and foremost, a gaming youtube banner template takes the tedium out of creating a design from scratch. They are also systematized, meaning you can download a template specifically for YouTube that comes in the correct dimensions.

Have a Consistent Layout"></a>1. Have a Consistent Layout</h2><p>Your thumbnails all must look like part of the same set. You want viewers to recognize your videos like yours, and they are more likely to do that if you build up a standard layout that they can start associating with you.</p><p>An example of a standard layout could be you in the middle of the screen wearing an expression that matches the theme of your video, with your title written underneath your face. Every individual thumbnail would still be different, but you and the text would always be in the same spot.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/consistent-layout.jpg"                      alt="Consistent Layout"                ></p><h2 id="2-Use-Your-Face"><a href="#2-Use-Your-Face" class="headerlink" title="2. Use Your Face"></a><strong>2. Use Your Face</strong></h2><p>People feel automatically connected and drawn into images that make eye contact. This makes thumbnails which feature faces more click-able than thumbnails which don’t, in most genres (i.e. if you make food videos then this may not apply – featuring the food might be more important than featuring your face). <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Check out more tips like this here <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</p><p>Also, if somebody recognizes you in your thumbnail from a previous video of yours, that will go a long way towards making them click.</p><h2 id="3-Use-Graphics-Emojis-that-are-On-Topic"><a href="#3-Use-Graphics-Emojis-that-are-On-Topic" class="headerlink" title="3. Use Graphics&#x2F;Emojis that are On Topic"></a>3. Use Graphics&#x2F;Emojis that are On Topic</h2><p>Anybody can take a screenshot of themselves in their video and use it as a thumbnail. To make your thumbnails look polished, consider using small images (like emojis or hearts) to stand out. This will add color and personality to your thumbnail.</p><p>Make sure the images you choose are relevant to the topic of your video.</p><h2 id="4-Make-Your-Text-Huge"><a href="#4-Make-Your-Text-Huge" class="headerlink" title="4. Make Your Text Huge"></a>4. Make Your Text Huge</h2><p>If you use text in your thumbnail (you don’t have to) then it should be to add context. For example, if the main image is just you smiling then you might need some text to let viewers know the video is a makeup tutorial.</p><p>Thumbnails might look large while you’re putting them together in your image editor, but when they’re displayed on YouTube they’re a lot smaller. That goes double if a viewer is watching on their phone. So, make sure that any text you use is large enough that it can be read easily on small screens.</p><h2 id="5-Keep-it-Clutter-Free"><a href="#5-Keep-it-Clutter-Free" class="headerlink" title="5. Keep it Clutter-Free"></a>5. Keep it Clutter-Free</h2><p>It’s great to add text and emojis to your thumbnails, but you do need to be careful not to add too much. You never want your thumbnails to look cluttered. Viewers should be able to glance at your thumbnails and know exactly what kind of video to expect – that’s difficult to do if there’s too much to process.</p><p>A good rule for text is to use only 1-3 words. That way they won’t clutter your screen, and you can make them large enough to read on small-screened devices.</p><p> <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >For even more tips on making great YouTube thumbnails, click here <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</p><p>Use these tips to make video thumbnails for YouTube, and tell us what kind of results you get!</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/richard-bennett.jpg"                      alt="author avatar"                ></p><p>Richard Bennett</p><p>Richard Bennett is a writer and a lover of all things video.</p><p>Follow @Richard Bennett</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://youtube-tips.techidaily.com/024-approved-the-ultimate-guide-to-valorant-video-thumbnail-artistry/"><u>[New] 2024 Approved  The Ultimate Guide to Valorant Video Thumbnail Artistry</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-tips.techidaily.com/ed-master-guide-to-youtube-community-expectations/"><u>[Updated] Master Guide to YouTube Community Expectations</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-tips.techidaily.com/ed-in-2024-leveraging-synergies-how-to-choose-ideal-youtube-duosgroups/"><u>[Updated] In 2024, Leveraging Synergies  How to Choose Ideal YouTube Duos/Groups</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-tips.techidaily.com/024-approved-formulating-final-fact-finding-flourishes/"><u>[New] 2024 Approved  Formulating Final Fact-Finding Flourishes</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-tips.techidaily.com/ngaging-audiences-youtube-shorts-vs-tiktok-trends/"><u>[New] Engaging Audiences  Youtube Shorts Vs.

Let’s discuss this scenario in detail in this article!</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/youtube-shorts-vs-tiktok.jpg"                      alt="filmora"                ></p><p>YouTube’s TikTok competitor, YouTube Shorts, is now rocking globally. Seeing the success of Instagram Reels and TikTok, it seems like YouTube didn’t want to lag behind the game. So in September last year, it decided to step into short-form content via YouTube Shorts, a social platform for quick 60-second videos hosted on the YouTube app.</p><p>According to the Shorts product lead <strong>Todd Sherman</strong>, the social media giant aims to unleash new grounds for creativity.</p><p>On the other hand, TikTok is a short-form, video-sharing app that assists users to share and make 15-second to 60-seconds videos on any topic.</p><p>TikTok contains a separate app for the Chinese market, <strong>Douyin</strong>, with 300 million-plus active monthly users. The new app’s logo is a merger of the Duyin and Musical.ly logos.</p><p>And, we’re going to discuss the comparison of both these giants, i.e., <strong>YouTube</strong> <strong>Shorts vs. TikTok</strong>, in terms of which app is better for making short videos.</p><h2 id="Part-1-Is-YouTube-Shorts-the-New-TikTok"><a href="#Part-1-Is-YouTube-Shorts-the-New-TikTok" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: Is YouTube Shorts the New TikTok?"></a>Part 1: Is YouTube Shorts the New TikTok?</h2><p>In general, we can’t say that YouTube Shorts is the new TikTok because YouTube Shorts is YouTube’s expansion and have its own identity than TikTok.</p><p>YouTube Shorts is playing hand in hand with TikTok as the short-form video platform, but the Shorts integration with the broader ecosystem of YouTube is its key selling point according to Google’s service.</p><p>Ironically, while YouTube is laying ways to emulate TikTok’s format, TikTok is experimenting with formats that are closer to YouTube’s traditional focus. This is why TikTok has tripled its maximum video length to three minutes for everyone and has been developing apps slowly on TV platforms like Fire TV and Android TV.</p><p>At a glance, YouTube Shorts looks pretty similar to TikTok. However, there are certain TikTok features that even the Shorts product manager Todd Sherman disagrees with is that of the YouTube Shorts. Sherman said the way TikTok works is quite an industry-wide standard than the point of view of any single app.</p><p>Even though YouTube is quite late to the short-form content game, it has a strong brand of YouTube behind it.</p><p>Thus, saying that “YouTube Shorts is the new TikTok” doesn’t even qualify in terms of the $100 million fund sanctioned for the creators of YouTube Shorts.</p><h2 id="Part-2-YouTube-Shorts-vs-TikTok-What-Are-the-Similarities-and-Differences"><a href="#Part-2-YouTube-Shorts-vs-TikTok-What-Are-the-Similarities-and-Differences" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: YouTube Shorts vs. TikTok: What Are the Similarities and Differences?"></a>Part 2: YouTube Shorts vs. TikTok: What Are the Similarities and Differences?</h2><p>In this section, we’ve defined the analysis of <strong>YouTube Shorts vs. TikTok</strong> in the form of both a comparison table and specific points of similarities and differences.</p><table><thead><tr><th><strong>Basis of Comparison</strong></th><th><strong>YouTube Shorts</strong></th><th><strong>TikTok</strong></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><strong>Video Length&#x2F;Duration</strong></td><td>Up to 60 seconds</td><td>Up to 3 minutes</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Aspect Ratio</strong></td><td>9:16</td><td>9:16</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Video Captions&#x2F;Description</strong></td><td>You can find the video title in the exact location as the TikTok caption, but the description is visible only after users click on the three dots.</td><td>Video captions are located at the bottom left.</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Placement of Analytics</strong></td><td>YouTube Studio</td><td>TikTok app itself</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Dislike Button</strong></td><td>Yes</td><td>No</td></tr></tbody></table><h3 id="Section-1-The-Similarities-Between-YouTube-Shorts-and-TikTok"><a href="#Section-1-The-Similarities-Between-YouTube-Shorts-and-TikTok" class="headerlink" title="Section 1. The Similarities Between YouTube Shorts and TikTok"></a>Section 1. The Similarities Between YouTube Shorts and TikTok</h3><ul><li>Both these platforms are for short-form video content.</li><li>The TikTok and YouTube Shorts both assist creators in adding music from their audio libraries, and users can view all videos beneath the audio library.</li><li>Both offer analytics, including video views, likes, comments, watch time, shares, impressions, and reach. You can view these analytics on a desktop or mobile device for both platforms.</li><li>The Shorts and TikTok feed provide a full-screen immersive experience with the engagement menu shown on the right-hand panel.</li><li>Their feeds scroll in the same manner. Plus, there is an endless number of videos lined up for users to discover and watch. Yet, there’s no auto-scroll on either, and users must scroll manually for the following video to come up.</li><li>Both provide tools that assist creators in earning money from their content creation.</li><li>Users can subscribe or follow creators directly from their videos in both feeds.</li><li>Both offer creators the ability to alter their video content’s speed and help them to set timers with the filming process.</li><li>YouTube Shorts TikTok give creators the ability to upload video content they’ve previously filmed.</li><li>You can add closed captions and overlaying text to both of these platforms.</li><li>They both assist creators in setting a video for the public, so anyone can view it or set it to private.</li></ul><h3 id="Section-2-The-Differences-Between-YouTube-Shorts-and-TikTok"><a href="#Section-2-The-Differences-Between-YouTube-Shorts-and-TikTok" class="headerlink" title="Section 2. The Differences Between YouTube Shorts and TikTok"></a>Section 2. The Differences Between YouTube Shorts and TikTok</h3><ul><li>The monetization features of both these platforms are entirely different. Shorts offer their ‘Shorts fund,’ whereas TikTok provides Shoutouts and Digital Gifts.</li><li>Shorts can only be 60-seconds long, whereas TikTok’s can be as long as three minutes (it could soon be stretched to five minutes duration as per their recent test).</li><li>TikTok allows users to add video captions that are present in the bottom left area of TikTok. At the same time, users can add a video title in Shorts which is present in the exact location as a TikTok caption. And, a video description that is only viewable when users click the three dots above the link button and click ‘Description’ can be in YouTube Shorts.</li><li>YouTube has a large music library which gives users an abundance of undiscovered and popular songs to select from, possibly more than the TikTok offerings list.</li><li>TikTok has a vast library of filters, including greenscreen and AR effects, whereas Shorts only provides filters that edit the video’s tone, temperature, brightness, etc.</li><li>Shorts’ ‘private’ video option allows creators to choose or see who watches your video. On the other hand, TikTok’s ‘private’ video option only allows the creator to view the video.</li><li>You can view the TikTok analytics directly in the TikTok app. On the other hand, YouTube Shorts analytics can be visible in YouTube Studio.</li></ul><h3 id="Features-TikTok-has-but-YouTube-Shorts-does-not…"><a href="#Features-TikTok-has-but-YouTube-Shorts-does-not…" class="headerlink" title="Features TikTok has, but YouTube Shorts does not…"></a>Features TikTok has, but YouTube Shorts does not…</h3><ul><li>A stitch and duet feature, where users can add other creators’ videos to their accounts.</li><li>A Q&amp;A feature to leave questions for creators to answer with a video. Creators can also reply to their comments.</li><li>A discovery tab that assists users in viewing trending sounds, effects, and hashtags.</li></ul><h3 id="Features-YouTube-Shorts-has-but-TikTok-does-not…"><a href="#Features-YouTube-Shorts-has-but-TikTok-does-not…" class="headerlink" title="Features YouTube Shorts has, but TikTok does not…"></a>Features YouTube Shorts has, but TikTok does not…</h3><ul><li>A scheduling tool that assists creators in scheduling the timing of their Shorts going live.</li><li>The option to select whether their videos are for kids or not. Or if they’d like to restrict their videos to viewers under 18.</li><li>You can edit even after publishing.</li><li>The option to “unlist” your Shorts, which means anyone can view it with a link to that video.</li></ul><h2 id="Part-3-YouTube-Shorts-vs-TikTok-Which-One-Is-Better-for-Short-Video-Promotion"><a href="#Part-3-YouTube-Shorts-vs-TikTok-Which-One-Is-Better-for-Short-Video-Promotion" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: YouTube Shorts vs. TikTok: Which One Is Better for Short Video Promotion"></a>Part 3: YouTube Shorts vs. TikTok: Which One Is Better for Short Video Promotion</h2><p>One of the differences that may determine the success of YouTube Shorts is that it is not a traditional social media app. While TikTok entices users to create, watch, and even share videos with friends within the app, the YouTube Shorts format is pretty different from TikTok.</p><p>Since YouTube doesn’t have this simple method of direct messaging and isn’t wholly dependent on creating, sharing, and watching Shorts, it looks that it may have a hard time keeping up with TikTok’s success.</p><p>Another drawback of YouTube Shorts in comparing <strong>YouTube Shorts vs.</strong> <strong>TikTok</strong> is that Shorts isn’t available through a dedicated app like TikTok. Thus, even though it keeps up the promise of creating, watching, and sharing both long and short-form content, it may turn away those who prefer focused access to quick content. Regardless, with YouTube Shorts now starting to become available to more users, the battle in the viral video market with TikTok is sure to heat up.</p><p>Before giving you our opinion on which is the better platform for short video promotion, go through the following conversation first.</p><p>Ramona Pringle is an associate professor and a tech expert at Toronto’s Ryerson University. She said in an interview that because YouTube already has figured out video content, the transformation to add short-form video will be natural.</p><p>She also mentioned that YouTube Shorts is the platform best placed with the competition from TikTok than all other platforms. However, YouTube doesn’t need to be TikTok as it has its strategies and broad audience base.</p><p>Like Pringle, Matt Navarra, a social media consultant based in the U.K., said in an interview that Shorts is a logical evolution and extension of YouTube, which has further given rise to TikTok. But unlike TikTok, Shorts has a few features that it can take benefit from. Among these features is the extensive audio library content, the greater scope for users to remix and create duets and stuff from scratch. Undoubtedly, you can’t deny the experience of YouTube in terms of access to partnerships with the music industry and licensing.</p><p>Thus, keeping all these factors in mind, we’d like to conclude that both the YouTube Shorts and TikTok are great and considerable platforms for short video promotion. Still, we’d like to place YouTube Shorts in the upper place due to its global availability. Whereas TikTok is already banned in certain countries.</p><p>It also depends upon the audience base of the country as to which platform is in use the most. Suppose it’s TikTok that people primarily use in a particular country or location where the brand wants to advertise itself. In that case, going with TikTok for short video promotion is better and vice versa.</p><p>To get more information, click the following video!</p><h3 id="TikTok-or-YouTube-Creators-at-VidCon-2023-Reveal-Their-Platform-of-Choice"><a href="#TikTok-or-YouTube-Creators-at-VidCon-2023-Reveal-Their-Platform-of-Choice" class="headerlink" title="TikTok or YouTube?

Not all your searches reflect your real tastes, and as your search history builds up the algorithm can start having trouble with all that data.</p><p>Here’s what you can do about it:</p><ol><li><a href="#manage"><strong>Manage Your Watch History</strong></a></li><li><a href="#notinterested"><strong>Tell YouTube You Aren’t Interested</strong></a></li><li><a href="#butwhy"><strong>But Why Does It Recommend Stuff I Don’t Like?</strong></a></li></ol><h2 id="Manage-Your-Watch-History"><a href="#Manage-Your-Watch-History" class="headerlink" title="Manage Your Watch History "></a>Manage Your Watch History <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/manage-watch-history.jpg"                      alt="Manage Watch History"                ></h2><p>Scroll to the bottom of any page on YouTube and you will see a button marked <strong>History</strong> with an hourglass icon. To access this feature using a mobile device, go to the <strong>Account</strong> tab and tap <strong>History</strong>.</p><p>You will be able to completely clear your watch history, remove specific videos from it, or pause your history while you look at videos you don’t want a record of you visiting. By taking control of your history, you can make sure nothing you looked up on a random whim is reflected in your recommendations.</p><p>If you are being recommended more things you aren’t interested in than things you are, you might want to clear your history completely and start fresh. Maybe your tastes have changed since YouTube started keeping track of them.</p><h2 id="Tell-YouTube-You-Aren’t-Interested"><a href="#Tell-YouTube-You-Aren’t-Interested" class="headerlink" title="Tell YouTube You Aren’t Interested "></a>Tell YouTube You Aren’t Interested <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/tell-youtube-not-interested.jpg"                      alt="Tell YouTube Not Interested"                ></h2><p>Based on your watch history, YouTube knows what you like. However, they have no way of automatically collecting data on what kinds of videos you’d rather not see.</p><p>What they do have is a system for you to flag recommendations you don’t like.</p><p>Hover over the thumbnail of a video you don’t want to be recommended to you and a small icon that looks like three stacked dots will appear next to the title. Click on that, and then click <strong>Not Interested</strong>.</p><p>When you tell YouTube you aren’t interested in certain videos they use that data to adjust what they recommend for you.</p><h2 id="But-Why-Does-It-Recommend-Stuff-I-Don’t-Like"><a href="#But-Why-Does-It-Recommend-Stuff-I-Don’t-Like" class="headerlink" title="But Why Does It Recommend Stuff I Don’t Like?"></a>But Why Does It Recommend Stuff I Don’t Like?</h2><p>Your search&#x2F;watch history is not the only thing that determines what YouTube recommends for you. Nobody outside of Google knows exactly how the algorithm works, but we do know one of the major factors influencing it is to watch <strong>time</strong>.</p><p>Watch time refers to how a video effects the session time of a viewer. If a video has proven it can keep viewers on YouTube for longer it is more likely to get recommended, even if it isn’t closely related to the interests of individual viewers. The ultimate goal of the algorithm is to keep you on the site longer. Part of that is recommending things, surely, you’ll be interested in, and part of that is trying to get you interested in things that’ll keep you around.</p><p>  A video that is simply watched for longer, because it is engaging and can hold viewers’ attention for a long time, will have a high watch time. So will a video that is short, but which leads into a playlist which holds peoples’ attention. If a video is a frequent session starter – people see it outside of YouTube (i.e. in a Google search) and get to the site through it – then its watch time will be high because it is given credit for all of the time viewers are spending on YouTube watching other videos after they get there.</p><p>The only way to stop certain types of videos from being recommended for you is to take advantage of the ‘not interested’ feature.</p><p> Are you usually happy with YouTube’s recommended videos?</p><h2 id="What-video-editing-software-did-YouTube-suggested-videos-are-used"><a

In order to do so, you want to click on the File button and then go to Import. You will see a side menu on which you need to click Media and select the file that you want to upload.

There are some points to be considered while creating a thumbnail for Youtube. We will provide you with the best practices that we have learned throughout our journey of using Youtube and growing it from zero.</p><p>7 best practices can help you make your Youtube thumbnail stand out from the crowd and make its way out.</p><ol><li><h4 id="Show-your-face"><a href="#Show-your-face" class="headerlink" title="Show your face"></a>Show your face</h4></li></ol><p>In a world full of machines and computers, people love to listen and interact with people instead of computer-generated voices and a voice without a face. Showing your face on a Youtube thumbnail makes it more appealing to users to click and listen to the person who is being shown in the thumbnail. Humans are more inclined towards faces. When there is a human element in a video, it increases its effectiveness. Check out the pics below, which one are you most likely to click through?</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/comparison-of-showing-face-or-not.png"                      alt="comparison-of-showing-face-or-not"                ></p><ol><li><h4 id="Use-Simple-Fonts"><a href="#Use-Simple-Fonts" class="headerlink" title="Use Simple Fonts"></a>Use Simple Fonts</h4></li></ol><p>With your face, it is necessary to put some text on your Youtube thumbnail to let viewers know what this video is all about without clicking or watching it. Don’t use fancy fonts on Youtube thumbnail. It makes it hard for the viewers to read and understand what to expect in the video, especially for those watching YouTube on their 5 inches screen smartphone, ultimately decreasing the chances of your video being clicked and watched. I personally recommend you to use give these fonts a go while making YouTube thumbnail.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/simple-fonts-recommended.png"                      alt="simple-fonts-recommended"                ></p><ol><li><h4 id="Use-Phrases-not-sentence"><a href="#Use-Phrases-not-sentence" class="headerlink" title="Use Phrases, not sentence"></a>Use Phrases, not sentence</h4></li></ol><p>If you have ever noticed, Youtube thumbnails are very small in size, making it hard for viewers to notice any small elements. According to <a class="link"   href="https://www.youtube.com/intl/en-GB/howyoutubeworks/" >YouTube <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, more than 70% of Youtube watch time comes from mobile devices. While adding text in a thumbnail, instead of using sentences, make sure to use only words and make them large in size that can easily be noticed on small screens. Summurise your video in no more than 5 words.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/piechart-youtube-watchtime-percentage.png"                      alt="piechart-youtube-watchtime-percentage"                ></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/use-phrases-not-sentences.jpg"                      alt="use-phrases-not-sentences"                ></p><ol><li><h4 id="Put-every-stuff-on-left-side"><a href="#Put-every-stuff-on-left-side" class="headerlink" title="Put every stuff on left side"></a>Put every stuff on left side</h4></li></ol><p>When we navigate to a Youtube thumbnail and place the cursor on it, it shows us two icons, “Watch Later” and “Add to Queue,” located on its right size. Come on, you don’t want your beautiful thumbnail that cost you a few hours be covered. To avoid these icons from hiding your important stuff of thumbnail, make sure to put everything on the right side of your thumbnail.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/put-stuff-on-left.jpg"                      alt="put-stuff-on-left"                ></p><ol><li><h4 id="Have-a-unique-and-Consistent-style"><a href="#Have-a-unique-and-Consistent-style" class="headerlink" title="Have a unique and Consistent style"></a>Have a unique and Consistent style</h4></li></ol><p>Try to make all your thumbnails follow the same style.

It is one of the best ways to show the viewers the content of your video even when they don’t click on your video. These three seconds will help them decide whether to click on your video or not. This preview is selected by the system from the first half of your video according to its relevance and similarity with the topic. That’s why it is very important to add related information in the first half of the video, otherwise, Youtube will choose it randomly. If the preview is not selected for two days, it means your video is not eligible for it.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/choose-preview-wisely.gif"                      alt="choose-preview-wisely"                ></p><hr><h2 id="How-to-Make-a-Fortnite-Thumbnail-Super-Fast-and-Free"><a href="#How-to-Make-a-Fortnite-Thumbnail-Super-Fast-and-Free" class="headerlink" title="How to Make a Fortnite Thumbnail Super Fast and Free?"></a>How to Make a Fortnite Thumbnail Super Fast and Free?</h2><p>Many of you might be interested in how to make a fortnite thumbnail, so here it is.

SocialBlade.com is a free-to-use website that displays your YouTube statistics – or the stats of any channel you are interested in – using an intuitive layout.</p><p>While many of the stats you can find on Social Blade are also available right on YouTube, some people find it easier to read on Social Blade.

It provides statistics on our subscribers, views, and estimated revenue.</p><p>To start using Social Blade, type your channel name into the search bar.</p><p>On the top section of the page, several stats will be clearly displayed.</p><p>First, you will see the letter grade assigned to your channel by Social Blade. If it is not a very good one, keep in mind that channels with over 10, 000 might still only receive Cs. Only YouTube megastars are getting As and Bs.</p><p>Next to your grade are your subscriber and video view ranks, as well as a rank assigned to you by Social Blade.</p><p>On the second line, you will see the views and subscribers you got in the last 30 days and the percentage by which you are up or down. Simply searching for yourself and glancing at this line is the easiest way to see whether your channel is growing, even easier than in your YouTube Creator Studio.</p><p>The final line of the first section will show you an estimate of your monthly revenue.</p><p>If you scroll down to the second section you will be able to see your views, subscribers, and estimated earnings per day rather than per month. Growth is in green and loss is in red.</p><p>By looking at this chart you can see which videos benefited your channel most after they were posted (your videos are not listed, but you can see based on the day you posted them). This will give you a good idea of what your audience wants to see.</p><h2 id="Spying-on-Other-Channels"><a href="#Spying-on-Other-Channels" class="headerlink" title="Spying on Other Channels"></a>Spying on Other Channels</h2><p>When you check your stats, you type your channel name into the search bar. If you want to use Social Blade to monitor somebody else’s stats, type their channel name instead.</p><p>By looking up your direct competitors (channels about the same size as yours within your same genre) you will be able to see which of their videos are performing best for them when you combine the daily information Social Blade provides with your knowledge of what videos they posted when.</p><p>Knowing what is working for your rivals will help you <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >design your content strategy <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</p><p>You can also use Social Blade to look up huge YouTube stars who you admire, just to see how well they are doing.

Live Performance"></a>1. Live Performance</h4><p>Raw talent that is unedited and uncut can make a huge impact on your audience. In the above video, William Singe and Alex Aiono perform a live mashup from beginning to end without stopping. This kind of all-in-one-take performance is even more impressive when it is flawless. If you’ve got what it takes to perform your music from beginning to end without stopping, try recording yourself doing a live performance.</p><h4 id="2-Cover-A-Classic-Song"><a href="#2-Cover-A-Classic-Song" class="headerlink" title="2. Cover A Classic Song"></a>2. Cover A Classic Song</h4><p>Although you might gain a lot of views in the short-run by covering a popular song that is currently in the top charts, you may find that your views will drop significantly in a few years when the song loses its relevance in pop culture. On the other hand, classic songs are timeless and performing them may even pleasantly evoke nostalgia to many listeners. In the video above, Daniela Andrade and HanByul Kang beautifully cover the 1934 jazz classic “Stars Fell on Alabama.” Do you have any favorite old classics?</p><h4 id="3-Cover-a-Popular-Song-With-Your-Own-Lyrics"><a href="#3-Cover-a-Popular-Song-With-Your-Own-Lyrics" class="headerlink" title="3. Cover a Popular Song With Your Own Lyrics"></a>3. Cover a Popular Song With Your Own Lyrics</h4><p>As mentioned above, covering a popular song that is currently in the top charts can bring in a lot of views. But since many people do just straight covers of songs, you’ll find yourself competing for views against many other musicians if you do the same. Creatively rewriting the lyrics of the song you choose to cover is one way you can set your cover apart from all the others out there. In the above video, the performer creatively sings a cover of MAGIC!’s “Rude” from the perspective of the father in the song.</p><h4 id="4-Cover-a-Popular-Song-In-a-Different-Genre"><a href="#4-Cover-a-Popular-Song-In-a-Different-Genre" class="headerlink" title="4.

Cover a Popular Song In a Different Genre</h4><p>Another way to set your cover apart from all the other many covers out there is to change up the genre. Whether or not everyone likes the genre you choose, it’s still undoubtedly interesting to hear a familiar song in such a different way. Postmodern Jukebox transforms a lot of current songs into old genres of music. Check out their jazzy version of Meghan Trainor’s “All About That Bass.”</p><h4 id="5-Show-Your-Musical-Adaptability-Through-Many-Genres"><a href="#5-Show-Your-Musical-Adaptability-Through-Many-Genres" class="headerlink" title="5. Show Your Musical Adaptability Through Many Genres"></a>5. Show Your Musical Adaptability Through Many Genres</h4><p>Professional musicians mostly adhere to fewer genres of music so that they don’t leave their listeners confused about who they are as a musician. This, at times, can get quite predictable and boring. Switching between multiple genres can be refreshingly interesting, especially if it’s many genres in one video. Rapper Mac Lethal explores 27 styles of rap in the above video.</p><h4 id="6-Cover-a-Popular-Song-With-a-Musical-Instrument-Or-With-Several-If-You-Know-How-To-Play-More-Than-One"><a href="#6-Cover-a-Popular-Song-With-a-Musical-Instrument-Or-With-Several-If-You-Know-How-To-Play-More-Than-One" class="headerlink" title="6. Cover a Popular Song With a Musical Instrument (Or With Several If You Know How To Play More Than One)"></a>6. Cover a Popular Song With a Musical Instrument (Or With Several If You Know How To Play More Than One)</h4><p>If you cover a popular song with a musical instrument, you not only have the potential to gain many views from people searching up your song, but you also have the potential to gain many views from people searching up your instrument. In the above video, Lily Liu performs “See You Again” on her Zither&#x2F;Guzheng.</p><h4 id="7-Play-Your-Musical-Instrument-In-a-Unique-Way"><a href="#7-Play-Your-Musical-Instrument-In-a-Unique-Way" class="headerlink" title="7. Play Your Musical Instrument In a Unique Way"></a>7. Play Your Musical Instrument In a Unique Way</h4><p>In much of the same way that performing a familiar song in a different genre can be refreshingly interesting, playing a familiar musical instrument in a different way can have the same effect. The above video is a YouTube classic video featuring Greg Pattillo playing his flute while simultaneously beatboxing.</p><h4 id="8-Cover-a-Popular-Song-Using-Odd-Non-Musical-Objects"><a href="#8-Cover-a-Popular-Song-Using-Odd-Non-Musical-Objects" class="headerlink" title="8. Cover a Popular Song Using Odd (Non-Musical) Objects"></a>8. Cover a Popular Song Using Odd (Non-Musical) Objects</h4><p>Since music is a combination of notes, you can practically create music out of anything that has a pitch, which is everything that makes a sound. With the power of editing and pitch manipulation, you can create fascinating instrumental covers like Andrew Huang’s 99 Red Balloons.</p><h4 id="9-Transform-Non-Melodic-Speech-Into-Music"><a href="#9-Transform-Non-Melodic-Speech-Into-Music" class="headerlink" title="9. Transform Non-Melodic Speech Into Music"></a>9. Transform Non-Melodic Speech Into Music</h4><p>There’s a lot you can do with music creation when you have access to software pitch manipulation. One of those things you can do is transform non-melodic speech into music. In the above video, many different clips of Donald Trump have been edited together to recreate Camila Cabello’s hit song “Havana.”</p><h4 id="10-Produce-a-Remix"><a href="#10-Produce-a-Remix" class="headerlink" title="10. Produce a Remix"></a>10. Produce a Remix</h4><p>Most of the ideas we mention in this list have to do with taking something already existing and transforming it into something new. Similarly, a remix is a transformative musical piece. But rather than performing your music in a different and interesting way, remixing involves producing digital music using music production software. In the above video, C2C remixes Stevie Wonder’s “Superstition.”</p><h4 id="11-Produce-a-Mashup"><a href="#11-Produce-a-Mashup" class="headerlink" title="11. Produce a Mashup"></a>11. Produce a Mashup</h4><p>Unlike a medley where you perform one song and then move onto the next in a sequential manner, in a mashup you blend parts and fragments of songs together in a non-sequential manner, oftentimes overlapping parts that belong to different songs (vocals from one song over the instrumental of another song). In order to do this in a way that ends up not sounding like a jumbled mess, you need to make sure all the parts you’re mixing together are not only in the same tempo, but also in the same key. My mashups have been shared all over the world.</p><h4 id="12-Make-An-Acapella-Arrangement"><a href="#12-Make-An-Acapella-Arrangement" class="headerlink" title="12. Make An Acapella Arrangement"></a>12. Make An Acapella Arrangement</h4><p>Most songs on the radio have all kinds of different sounds going on that it can be difficult to just appreciate and enjoy the sound of the human voice. Acapella arrangements, on the other hand, attempt to recreate music with just the voice. Your own voice is a musical instrument that you can use in so many different ways to make all kinds of unique sounds. Mike Tompkins is someone who has made his mark on YouTube as an acapella musician.</p><h4 id="13-Impersonate-Celebrities"><a href="#13-Impersonate-Celebrities" class="headerlink" title="13. Impersonate Celebrities"></a>13. Impersonate Celebrities</h4><p>If you’re a musician who also happens to be good at doing impersonations of celebrities, recording yourself performing a song in different voices that others are familiar with can be a huge hit. In the above video, Yanina Chiesa performs a medley of songs featuring 15 different celebrity singers.</p><h4 id="14-Music-Tutorial"><a href="#14-Music-Tutorial" class="headerlink" title="14. Music Tutorial"></a>14. Music Tutorial</h4><p>YouTube is the go-to place for many people who want to learn how to do something, including music. In the above video, Anna-Maria Hefele explains how polyphonic overtone singing works.</p><h4 id="15-Make-A-Song-So-Bad-It-Just-Might-Go-Viral"><a href="#15-Make-A-Song-So-Bad-It-Just-Might-Go-Viral" class="headerlink" title="15. Make A Song So Bad, It Just Might Go Viral"></a>15. Make A Song So Bad, It Just Might Go Viral</h4><p>Making music that’s so bad that it goes viral is not as easy as you might think. When it comes to bad quality material, there’s probably more of those on YouTube than there is good quality material. Your music will have to be extra bad in order to stand out among the competition. Rebecca Black’s “Friday” is a notable example of this last YouTube video idea.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/richard-bennett.jpg"                      alt="author avatar"                ></p><p>Richard Bennett</p><p>Richard Bennett is a writer and a lover of all things video.</p><p>Follow @Richard Bennett</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://youtube-tips.techidaily.com/024-approved-blitz-broadcasting-channel-your-playlist-swiftly/"><u>[New] 2024 Approved  Blitz Broadcasting  Channel Your Playlist Swiftly</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-tips.techidaily.com/n-2024-youtube-shorts-earnings-guide-must-knows-and-future-potential/"><u>[New] In 2024, Youtube Shorts Earnings Guide  Must-Knows & Future Potential</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-tips.techidaily.com/24-hone-your-message-effective-use-of-templates-for-shorts/"><u>In 2024, Hone Your Message  Effective Use of Templates for Shorts</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-tips.techidaily.com/024-approved-strategic-content-creation-unleashing-ideas-through-google-trends/"><u>[New] 2024 Approved  Strategic Content Creation  Unleashing Ideas Through Google Trends</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-tips.techidaily.com/-easy-youtube-audio-extraction-methods-free-and-secure/"><u>[New] 3 Easy YouTube Audio Extraction Methods  Free & Secure</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-tips.techidaily.com/ating-earnings-from-one-million-youtube-watches-for-2024/"><u>Evaluating Earnings From One Million YouTube Watches for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-tips.techidaily.com/24-the-12-step-youtube-seo-guide-for-beginners-who-want-more-views/"><u>In 2024, The 12-Step YouTube SEO Guide for Beginners Who Want More Views</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-tips.techidaily.com/n-2024-comprehensive-guide-to-youtube-video-captioning/"><u>[New] In 2024, Comprehensive Guide to YouTube Video Captioning</u></a></li><li><a href="https://review-topics.techidaily.com/possible-solutions-to-restore-deleted-photos-from-samsung-galaxy-z-flip-5-by-fonelab-android-recover-photos/"><u>Possible solutions to restore deleted photos from Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 5.</u></a></li><li><a href="https://iphone-unlock.techidaily.com/in-2024-unlock-your-disabled-apple-iphone-14-without-itunes-in-5-ways-drfone-by-drfone-ios/"><u>In 2024, Unlock Your Disabled Apple iPhone 14 Without iTunes in 5 Ways | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://instagram-clips.techidaily.com/new-2024-approved-enhancing-video-content-step-by-step-cropping-and-export-guide/"><u>[New] 2024 Approved  Enhancing Video Content  Step-by-Step Cropping & Export Guide</u></a></li><li><a href="https://tiktok-video-recordings.techidaily.com/new-2024-approved-unleash-viral-potential-with-these-tiktok-ideas/"><u>[New] 2024 Approved  Unleash Viral Potential with These TikTok Ideas</u></a></li><li><a href="https://techidaily.com/how-to-reset-your-apple-iphone-6-drfone-by-drfone-ios-system-repair-ios-system-repair/"><u>How To Reset Your Apple iPhone 6? | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://instagram-clips.techidaily.com/in-2024-quick-start-uploading-your-videos-to-instagram-via-pcmac/"><u>In 2024, Quick Start  Uploading Your Videos to Instagram via PC/Mac</u></a></li><li><a href="https://ai-driven-video-production.techidaily.com/easily-flip-videos-online-with-these-web-apps-for-2024/"><u>Easily Flip Videos Online with These Web Apps for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://smart-video-editing.techidaily.com/quicktime-player-hacks-how-to-speed-up-videos-on-windows-and-mac-devices-for-2024/"><u>QuickTime Player Hacks How to Speed Up Videos on Windows and Mac Devices for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://video-content-creator.techidaily.com/updated-2024-approved-edit-in-high-def-the-best-video-software/"><u>Updated 2024 Approved Edit in High-Def The Best Video Software</u></a></li></ul></div>]]></content>

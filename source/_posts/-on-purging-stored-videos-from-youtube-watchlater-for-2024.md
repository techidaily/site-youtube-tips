## Guide on Purging Stored Videos From YouTube Watchlater

The YouTube Watch Later playlist is a great way to save videos and view them later. But if you don't keep on top of it, your Watch Later list can quickly become unmanageable and cluttered with content that you no longer want to watch afterward.

If you are wondering how, you can declutter the playlist, we've got you covered. To help you with the task, we've compiled a comprehensive step-by-step guide. In this article, we will show you how to clear Watch Later on YouTube with just a few clicks.

So, without beating around the bush, let's get started with our tutorial!

## How To Delete YouTube Watch Later Playlist

If your YouTube Watch Later playlist is filled with videos you'll never watch again, or you are not interested in that specific content type, you can quickly delete these videos at any time.

Here's the step-by-step process on **how to clear Watch Later on YouTube Web and App:**

### How To Delete YouTube Watch Later Playlist On Web?

You can delete the YouTube Watch Later Playlist on your desktop in the following ways:

##### From YouTube Homepage

To clear the YouTube Watch Later Playlist from the YouTube Homepage, do the following steps:

Step1 First, open a browser on your PC and visit the [**YouTube homepage**](https://www.youtube.com/index?feature=signin)**.** Sign into your account if needed and click the **"Library"** option located at the left-hand side menu panel.

![accessing the youtube web library](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/03/accessing-the-youtube-web-library.png)

Step2 Croll down and click the **"See All"** option under the Watch Later header. Click the **Three Dots** below the Watch Later playlist details on the next page.

Step3 From the drop-down menu, click **"Remove Watch Videos."** This will instantly remove all the videos you've watched but are still in the playlist.

Step4 Finally, to remove the unwatched videos, hover over a video and click the **Three Dots**. Select the **"Remove from Watch Later"** option to delete the video. You can repeat this process to remove all the content from the playlist until it is decluttered at the point of your satisfaction.

##### Using A Script

Since the above process can be tiring, you can use a script to remove all the videos at once from the Watch Later playlist in the following way:

Step1 In the first step, launch the [**Google Chrome**](https://www.google.com/intl/en%5Fpk/chrome/) browser on your system and head to the **YouTube** website**.** Next, select the **"Library"** option in the left pane and click **"Watch Later"** from the menu.

Step2 Now, hit the **"Ctrl + Shift + J"** keys on Windows or the **"Command + Option+ J"** buttons on Mac to launch the developer mode and open the console window.

![using script to clear watch later](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/03/using-script-to-clear-watch-later.png)

Step3 Copy and paste the following lines of the script at the end of the line under the Console tab where the cursor is blinking.

setInterval(function () { document.querySelector('#primary button\[aria-label="Action menu"\]').click(); var things = document.evaluate('//span\[contains(text(),"Remove from")\]', document, null, XPathResult.ORDERED\_NODE\_SNAPSHOT\_TYPE, null ); for (var i = 0; i < things.snapshotLength; i++) { things.snapshotItem(i).click(); } }, 1000);

Step4 In the last step, hit the **"Enter"** key to clear the Watch Later Playlist on YouTube. However, the process may take some time, depending on the number of videos in your playlist.

Although a bit tech-savvy, the script execution method is the most effective way to delete all Watch Later videos at once.

You can also replace the number at the end of the script with a lower entry to delete videos according to your preference. Also, choosing a lesser number can speed up the video deletion process from YouTube Watch Later list by a great deal.

**Note:** It is important to note that experimenting with scripts is only for some. The script above has been confirmed to work, but others still need to be thoroughly checked and could potentially damage your computer. To prevent this from happening, only look for scripts from reliable sources instead of those posted by random people in various forums.

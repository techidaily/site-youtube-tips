## The Mobile Filmmaker’s Playbook: Crafting Compelling YouTubes Thumbnails

As a content creator, you know the importance of a visually appealing thumbnail for YouTube videos. It gives your viewers a sneak peek of what they can expect from your video and helps it stand out in the crowded world of YouTube.

When creating your thumbnail, it's important to remember that the recommended size is 1280 x 720 pixels and a minimum width of 640 pixels. With these dimensions in mind, let's dive into how you can easily create stunning thumbnails for your YouTube videos using your mobile phone.

![make thumbnails or youtube with mobile phones](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/how-to-make-thumbnail-for-youtube-in-mobile.jpg)

## Method 1\. Make a YouTube Thumbnail on iPhone With the iPhone Photos App

One way to create a thumbnail for your YouTube video on your iPhone is to use the built-in Photos app. The Photos app comes pre-installed on all iPhones and offers a range of editing tools you can use to create a thumbnail.

The Photos app on your iPhone offers a range of features that you can use to create a custom thumbnail for your YouTube video. Here are some of the features you can use:

* **Crop:** The crop tool allows you to resize and reposition your thumbnail image by trimming away any unnecessary parts of the image.
* **Rotate:** The rotate tool lets you adjust the orientation of your thumbnail image. You can rotate the image clockwise or counterclockwise to achieve the desired angle.
* **Adjust lighting and color:** The lighting and color tools allow you to adjust the brightness, contrast, saturation, and other aspects of the thumbnail image to enhance its overall appearance.
* **Add text:** You can use the text tool to add words or phrases to your thumbnail image. This can be a great way to include a call-to-action or to highlight a key feature of your video.
* **Add filters and stickers:** The Photos app includes a range of filters and stickers that you can use to give your thumbnail image a unique look. You can experiment with filters and stickers to find the perfect one for your thumbnail.

To create a thumbnail using the Photos app on your iPhone, follow these steps:

Step1 Open the Photos app and find the image you want to use as your thumbnail. **Tap** on the image to open it.

Here are some common questions that people have when it comes to creating YouTube thumbnails on mobile.

### Q1\. What App Do Youtubers Use To Make Thumbnails?

There are many different apps and tools that YouTubers use to create thumbnails for their videos. The best app for creating YouTube thumbnails will depend on your needs and skill level.

If you're looking for a quick and easy way to create a thumbnail on your mobile device, start with the built-in Photos app or a third-party app like Canva. If you need more advanced customization options or are comfortable with graphic design software, consider using Adobe Photoshop or another tool.

### Q2\. What Is YouTube Thumbnail Size?

The recommended size for YouTube thumbnails is 1280 x 720 pixels. This size balances quality and file size, ensuring that your thumbnail looks sharp and loads quickly. It's also important to note that YouTube thumbnails are displayed at different sizes depending on the device and context in which they are viewed.

For example, a thumbnail may be displayed at a larger size when it's shown as the main thumbnail for a video but smaller when it's shown in a list of related videos.

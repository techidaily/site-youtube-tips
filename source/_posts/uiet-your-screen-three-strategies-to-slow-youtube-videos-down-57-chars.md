## Part 3: Slow down YouTube videos with Slow Motion in YouTube Video Editor

**Updated:** From 20th September 2017 users will no longer be able to use the complimentary editing suite. Check the best [YouTube video editor alternatives](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) from this complete guide.

If you've ever been annoyed by the speed of your user-generated videos on YouTube, try out its own video editor. As YouTube has added a new "slow motion" tool to its YouTube Editor, it does pretty much exactly what it sounds like. Here is a simple guide on how to add slow motion with it.

**Step 2:** Drag your video on the timeline and double click it. In the pop up window, you will see the "Slow Motion" option. Enable it and then select how slow you want the video to be. This applies the effect to the entire video that you've selected.

![slow motion youtube video](https://images.wondershare.com/images/multimedia/video-editor/youtube-slow-motion.png)

If you just want to slow down parts of the video, go back to the main editing tab, clip it from the original video using the slicing tool and add the slow-motion effect to that clip only. You can then arrange the different clips you have in the editor to create your final video.

**Step 3:** Tick the option "Preview effects side-by-side" with original video and then you can see how the original video plays compared to the one you've slowed down. If you're happy with the result, hit "Done" to save the settings.

**Conclusion**

Above are the 3 ways that you can watch a YouTube video in slow motion, and slow down YouTube videos. You can directly change the playback speed of the YouTube video on Youtube, or download the YouTube video first and then slow down the speed of the YouTube video with some video editing software for YouTube like Filmora.

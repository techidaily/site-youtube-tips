![youtube affilate marketing](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/does-youtube-pay-monthly-2.jpg)

You might have come across YouTube videos where the creators talk about their favorite brands and add links to the platform for the brand. Well, that’s a form of affiliate marketing.

So, when anyone purchases the product using your affiliate link, you’ll get your percentage off the price they paid. On average, companies will be willing to pay within 5% to 50% of the purchase price.

YouTube is a social platform that relies on visually exciting material to attract the audience. Just like a book with an appealing cover compels a person to pick it up and read, it is significant to display and advertise your YouTube channel in a way that makes viewers click and browse through the channel.

Despite creating a beautiful banner on your desktop screen, it might end up distorted on a mobile screen if the recommended sizes for all kinds of gadgets are not followed. Hence, choosing your YouTube channel art dimension is essential since it is the viewer's first impression. To commence with, you must be careful about your **YouTube banner size** and **channel art dimensions**. Are you wondering how to create the perfect banner or cover photo as we know it?

## Part 1: The Recommended YouTube Banner Size

According to YouTube's official standards, the recommended banner size is 2560×1440 pixels. However, the minimum image dimensions are 2048×1152 pixels. To ensure that your text is visible regardless of the screen size, sticking to the "safe area" of 2560×423 pixels is the best option. Why are these sizes significant? Well, it's essential to keep in mind the fact that people worldwide will be using different kinds of gadgets to access YouTube, and it is crucial to optimize your YouTube banner size for it to be ideal.

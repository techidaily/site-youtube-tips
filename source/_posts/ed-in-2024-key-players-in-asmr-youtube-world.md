 Mar 27, 2024• Proven solutions

Achieving a state of peace and tranquility isn’t always easy, in fact, a growing number of studies indicate that most people find it difficult to relax after a long day. The ensuing stress can cause insomnia, anxiety, depression, and a broad range of other psychological problems.

ASMR videos are a booming trend on YouTube as channels that post this type of content are attracting millions of followers. These videos contain audio and visual stimuli that can trigger the autonomous sensory meridian response that is characterized by the tingling which spreads from the top of the head downward.

So, in this article, we are going to take you through some of the best ASMR YouTube channels and help you discover the one that relaxes you the most.

## Part 1: The Best ASMR Sleep Channels

The staggering amount of ASMR content on YouTube makes finding the channels that offer videos that help the viewer fall asleep a difficult task. We’ve combed through YouTube in search of the best ASMR Sleep channels, so let's take a closer look at our selection.

### 1\. ASMR Darling

The ASMR Darling channel was started in 2014 and since then it gained a massive following. Today, it has more than 2.5 million subscribers which makes it one of the most successful ASMR channels on YouTube.

The videos are focused around visual and audio ASMR triggers as their host usually uses whispering, role play, tapping, scratching, and microphone brushing. In addition, some videos also contain compliments, affirmations, and face touching that can potentially serve as tactile ASMR triggers. Each video on the ASMR Darling channel is created with the aim to relax the viewer and help them unwind before falling asleep.

### 2\. Pelagea ASMR

With nearly one million subscribers Pelagea ASMR is easily one of the most popular ASMR sleep channels on YouTube. The duration of an average video on this channel exceeds twenty minutes which helps the viewer fall asleep while the video they are watching is still playing in the background.

The content on this channel is usually focused on audio triggers as the video that contains kissing noises has more than 19 million views. In addition, the host of these videos often taps her long fingernails over different types of objects. One thing is certain, the content you’ll find on this channel will alleviate the migraines you’re experiencing and improve the quality of your sleep.

### 3\. Stacy Aster

Although Stacy Aster’s channel may not be as popular as ASMR Darling or Pelagea ASMR the content she produces is undoubtedly relaxing. Stacy utilizes more than five hundred ASMR triggers in her videos, which means that you will surely find the sounds that trigger your autonomous sensory meridian response.

Even though she started her channel just three years ago, Stacy already has more than half a million followers and an impressive collection of videos that contains hundreds of hours of relaxing content. She doesn’t focus exclusively on ASMR sleep videos as she also creates slime ASMR and other types of ASMR content.

### 4\. ASMR Zeitgeist

In a little, over five years this ASMR channel has amassed 1.77M subscribers, which speaks volumes about the quality of the content it offers. The majority of videos rely on audio triggers to spark the ASMR and relax the viewer.

The artist’s experimental approach to ASMR videos results in calming and entertaining content. On this channel, you can find underwater ASMR sounds, videos that contain pink-colored triggers and so much more. The best part is that each video on this channel contains a variety of common and not so common ASMR triggers, which enables you to discover new sounds that may help you relax without even having to change a video.

### 5\. ASMR PPOMO

Arguably one of the oldest ASMR channels on YouTube, ASMR PPomo was started in 2013 just three years after this phenomenon started attracting the attention of the online community. The videos you can find on this channel combine audio and visual triggers that loosen the viewers up and lull them to sleep.

Besides crating relaxing videos this Korean ASMR artist enjoys playing video games and listening to music. The fascination with sounds translates into her passion for ASMR as she employs hundreds of different ASMR triggers that cause tingles. Moreover, ASMR PPOMO channel hosts role play videos that take place in the magic shop, Halloween, and numerous other settings.

## Part 2: The Best ASMR Eating Channels

YouTube is flooded with videos that are related to food in one way or the other, which is why it is hardly surprising that some of the most popular ASMR channels contain footage of hosts eating different types of food. Watching or hearing someone prepare or eat food can trigger ASMR, so if you are a foodie you are going to love watching videos from these channels.

### 1\. SAS-ASMR

The fact that SAS-ASMR has 8.87 million subscribers points out just how popular this channel really is. The most popular videos on this channel have 45 million, 35 million, and 27 million views and they all include the sounds of the host eating different types of foods.

You can watch the host eat a honeycomb, a salmon as well as different types of exotic foods, and listen to the chewing or crunching sounds at the same time. However, SAS-ASMR is not exclusively ASMR eating channel as it also offers videos that have whispering sounds.

### 2\. FoodieLicious ASMR

This is a relatively new ASMR channel with a modest following. Even so, FoodieLicious ASMR has an impressive collection of food videos which enables you to watch the host eat food from McDonald’s or spicy Indonesian food.

In addition to relaxing with the sounds of a person chewing food, you can also use this channel to discover dishes you never tasted before. New content is uploaded weekly so that you can enjoy new sounds every week.

The host creates crunchy sounds while eating different types of fast foods, noodles, or pizza. Moreover, the new content is uploaded regularly so that you can never run out of sounds that trigger your ASMR.

### 4\. Morpheus ASMR

In most videos, the host is simply enjoying himself while eating Domino’s pizza, quarter pounder with cheese, or different types of cakes. There are nearly 400 videos on this channel and hopefully, you will be able to find at least one that contains the ASMR trigger you are sensitive to.

### 5\. ASMR Phan

This channel is focused exclusively on ASMR eating videos, but you can follow the Mini Phan Club channel that combines the features of family vlog with ASMR videos. Both of these channels are run by twin sisters Alex and Lexi who love creating mukbangs in which they eat different types of foods.

The most popular uploads on ASMR Phan have over 18 million views which show vividly how sought after the content on this channel really is. In case you love watching people eat fast food, fruits, or candy this channel is the perfect choice for you.

## Part 3: The Best YouTube Slime AMSR Channels

That’s why it is important to discover channels that produce relaxing and entertaining content that meets the highest industry standards. In addition, the number of ASMR triggers you can find on a YouTube channel determines whether or not you’re going to experience tingles while you’re watching some of the videos it offers.

## The Ultimate Checklist for Becoming a Youtuber

#### \- Make A Decision on Your Niche

What do you want to achieve with your YouTube channel? Do you want to make instructive videos to help others? Do you want to create how-to videos and tutorials to show others how to do things?

It will also help you get off to a good and consistent start rather than attempting to cover everything all at once.

#### \- Come Up with Content Ideas

\- Make A Content Calendar

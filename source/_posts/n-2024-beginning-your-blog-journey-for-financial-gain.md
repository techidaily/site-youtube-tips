What started off as a way for vloggers to share their thoughts about topics they were passionate about eventually turned into a full-blown industry. According to Pew Research, there are more than two million vloggers, and the audience for vlogs has grown from around 200 million viewers in 2012 to over 700 million in 2017\. Vloggers like Logan Paul, HJ Evelyn, Ur Mom Ashley, and Roman Atwood are some names helping to shape the industry.

**Why vlogs are loved by people**

Vlogs are short, informal videos posted online on platforms like YouTube. Think of them as the modern equivalent of early television (TV) shows. They allow creators to connect directly with their audiences, share their opinions, and be creative in a way that wasn’t possible before. They can be fun, entertaining, informational, and even educational.

But most importantly, they’re easy to make and easy to watch. The most popular ones out there are HJ Evelyn and UR Mom Ashley. Their videos are pure chaos and fun to watch.

## Part 1: Why Can’t I Make Money Through My Vlog?

So you've started filming videos on YouTube vlogs, but why aren't you making any money from them? Is it something you can change? Let's look at some common reasons why vloggers aren't making any income and figure out how to get around them.

### Who is my target audience?

![target audience](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/how-to-start-a-vlog-and-make-money-3.jpg)

So, let's be honest; most vloggers focus on the wrong audience. Most vloggers think they're not making money because they haven't figured out the right audience for their videos. But the reason why most vloggers aren't making money is that the majority of their audience is just not interested in them. It seems strange to say it, but when it comes down to it, most vloggers they're trying to appeal to the wrong type of people.

It seems that more and more vloggers are doing videos today. However, so many vloggers aren't making money because they are trying to solve problems that no one wants to hear about! Make videos on the problem many people want to know about; they will want to see what you are saying—resulting in more views and money.

### What solutions am I offering? Are these solutions both financially viable for you and in line with the needs of your target audience?

The internet provides many tools and resources to help vloggers find a job or business. Youtubers provide quality content, but some fall short of providing solutions. As a vlogger, it is your job to help potential clients identify what solution you are offering. You must be able to prove your expertise. You need to see if you're addressing the target audience's needs.

## Part 2:How To Start a Profitable Vlog YouTube Channel

It's easy to get started on YouTube. Go to the website, set up a free account, and upload videos. But when it comes to growing a profitable vlog YouTube channel, there are some tricks to getting the best results. Here are the three things you must do to achieve the success that will bring you money.

### Find your niche. (what is a niche, and how to find)

A niche is a more specific topic than your normal interests and therefore requires more thought and research. Finding a niche means narrowing down what you're passionate about and what you're good at and carving out a community of viewers who want what you're offering. Once you figure out your niche, the next step is to create content that suits your niche and what you want to share.

### Consistency and patience

Another thing that makes vlogging a successful business is consistency. Vloggers who put out new content every week or even every day may get a lot of views. A consistent schedule means you can produce new videos that will retain people's interest and keep them returning for more. Also, YouTube algorithms favor timely, fresh, and well-made videos. You must be patient and wait to get the attention of YouTube's algorithm.

### Content quality

With the success of big YouTube stars like Markiplier and Casey Neistat, it's clear that the market is for quality vlog content which is quite lucrative. YouTube's algorithm favors videos with large numbers of views, so if you're looking to start a profitable vlog YouTube channel, you'll need to add quality, creativity, and useful content for viewers.

And to do that, you must try [Wondershare Filmora](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) video editing software. Let’s have an overview of WonderShare Filmora 11 and how we can create quality content using it.

## Part 3: Common Methods of Vlogging Income

We've seen so much misinformation about how to make money via vlogging. This makes it hard to figure out what works and what doesn't.

### YouTube Ads
![youtube advertising](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/how-to-start-a-vlog-and-make-money-6.jpg)

Ad revenue comes from advertisers who pay to show their brand message across the top of the video. Advertisers choose which ads are displayed, so don't let a video with few views make you think you can't make money with your videos. The key is to monetize your content and become eligible for Youtube ads.

According to Google, a publisher (Youtuber) will get 68% of ad revenue. An advertiser's actual rate varies, but it averages almost $0.18\. That means that for every 1000 ad views, a vlogger will receive $18.

### Brand Sponsorship
![sponsorship](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/how-to-start-a-vlog-and-make-money-7.jpg)

While the vlogger market is still young, brands are starting to recognize its enormous potential for brand recognition, building a community, and engaging with current and potential customers.

Vloggers also use their videos to demonstrate how a product should be used and answer questions about the brand, its products, and services. As well as they will often provide some insight into a product or service through creative storytelling.

Affiliate marketing is another form of monetization for online video bloggers. In affiliate marketing, bloggers earn commissions by referring traffic to affiliate products through affiliate links. The goal of affiliate marketing is to drive sales and build a sustainable source of revenue, whether it's through Amazon, Google, or other platforms.

### Patreon

By creating a Patreon account, you are allowing people to donate money to help support your content creation. In return, you offer rewards to supporters of your channel. Rewards could include extra content, merchandise, access to private forums, or even free ebooks.

## Hot FAQs on How To Start a Vlog and Make Money

### 1\. Is daily vlogging worth it?

Yes, daily vlogs are the perfect way to establish yourself as an online expert if you think of it as a business. With the right strategy, there is no doubt that starting daily vlogs will be worthwhile for your business.

However, many vloggers have found that it isn't easy to stick to the routine. You may start losing quality, and as a result, your daily vlogs performance degrades. This can be a frustrating experience for you, so you must consider this before embarking on a daily vlogging project.

### 2\. What is the best topic for vlogging?

There isn't a specific topic for vlogging. The best topics to cover on any vlog can be the vlogger's most interesting thing of his life, what he loves doing, what makes him feel like making a difference in the community, or what he wants people to remember about the vlog. It all comes down to a person's personality, interests, and preferences.

Finding a niche means narrowing down what you're passionate about and what you're good at and carving out a community of viewers who want what you're offering. Once you figure out your niche, the next step is to create content that suits your niche and what you want to share.

### Consistency and patience

Another thing that makes vlogging a successful business is consistency. Vloggers who put out new content every week or even every day may get a lot of views. A consistent schedule means you can produce new videos that will retain people's interest and keep them returning for more. Also, YouTube algorithms favor timely, fresh, and well-made videos. You must be patient and wait to get the attention of YouTube's algorithm.

We've seen so much misinformation about how to make money via vlogging. This makes it hard to figure out what works and what doesn't.

### YouTube Ads
![youtube advertising](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/how-to-start-a-vlog-and-make-money-6.jpg)

Ad revenue comes from advertisers who pay to show their brand message across the top of the video. Advertisers choose which ads are displayed, so don't let a video with few views make you think you can't make money with your videos. The key is to monetize your content and become eligible for Youtube ads.

According to Google, a publisher (Youtuber) will get 68% of ad revenue. An advertiser's actual rate varies, but it averages almost $0.18\. That means that for every 1000 ad views, a vlogger will receive $18.

### Brand Sponsorship

## Hot FAQs on How To Start a Vlog and Make Money

### 1\. Is daily vlogging worth it?

Yes, daily vlogs are the perfect way to establish yourself as an online expert if you think of it as a business. With the right strategy, there is no doubt that starting daily vlogs will be worthwhile for your business.

However, many vloggers have found that it isn't easy to stick to the routine. You may start losing quality, and as a result, your daily vlogs performance degrades. This can be a frustrating experience for you, so you must consider this before embarking on a daily vlogging project.

### 2\. What is the best topic for vlogging?

There isn't a specific topic for vlogging. The best topics to cover on any vlog can be the vlogger's most interesting thing of his life, what he loves doing, what makes him feel like making a difference in the community, or what he wants people to remember about the vlog. It all comes down to a person's personality, interests, and preferences.

### 3\. What equipment do I need to start vlogging?

With a tripod, the most basic gear to start vlogging is a camera, microphone, and computer. Vloggers typically use cameras that range from DSLRs (digital single lens reflex) to iPhones.

In addition to the gear needed to get started, there is one more item you'll need to consider to produce quality vlogs. A video editing software that helps you convert your raw footage into eye-catching content, like Wondershare Filmora.

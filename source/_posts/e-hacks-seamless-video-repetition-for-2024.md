A loop video is a short video that plays in repeat/ indefinitely. Loop videos can be created with features on social media apps and third-party apps.

iPhone has a setting that allows you to edit the photos to loop or bounce videos, and it only works with a photo feature called 'live photo'. The live photo feature records 1.5 seconds moving picture when you click on the shutter button.

The live photo feature can be edited to create a loop video, and you can do that by following these steps:

1. Before creating the video, you need to have the live picture saved on your phone.

To do this, capture a live photo by opening your camera app. Then click on the live photo icon, which is located in the upper right corner. And tap on the shutter button.

1. Afterward, you locate the live photo you want to convert to a loop video by going to the Photos apps. Then click on _Albums > Media Types> Live photos._

![iPhone Media types](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/iphone-live-photos-media-types.jpg)

1. After locating and clicking on the live picture, you will see the _Live_ tab in the upper left corner. Click on the arrow down to view other options, including Loop, Bounce, and long exposure.

![iPhone live photos options](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/iphone-live-photos-options.jpg)

1. Select the effect you want to create (loop) and save the file. The loop feature plays the video in a one-way order. So, to make it more interesting, you can select the bounce effect, which makes it play back and forth.
2. You can share the created loop video with the share icon at the lower-left corner.

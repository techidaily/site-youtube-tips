By going through his first videos, you'll get a general idea of the basics of how to approach the stock market in 2022\. He advocates more long-term investments and because he's located in the United States, most of the information about stocks is about U.S. stocks. This is not necessarily a bad thing as many of the largest companies in the world trade in the U.S. stock market. He's very reciprocal and willing to share new ideas with his members. Definitely a good start if you want to dig more into stocks. He started his channel back in 2021 and releases videos once a week.

### 3. Young And Investing

This channel releases two videos every quarter, which means these are usually longer and encompass more information than the channels that release videos every week.

With more than 7 million views since the creation of the channel in April 2017, Young And Investing have one of the biggest following in this area.

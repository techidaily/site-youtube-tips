## The Ultimate Checklist for Becoming a Youtuber

#### \- Make A Decision on Your Niche

For example, a fitness YouTuber would make videos about workouts and a healthy diet.

#### \- Describe The Purpose of Your Channel

What do you want to achieve with your YouTube channel? Do you want to make instructive videos to help others? Do you want to create how-to videos and tutorials to show others how to do things?

#### \- Come Up with Content Ideas

\- Make A Content Calendar

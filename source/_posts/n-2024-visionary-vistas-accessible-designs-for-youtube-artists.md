## 2\. [Canva](https://www.canva.com)

_Phil from Video School Online’s Canva tutorial._

Canva is a free online program you can use to create all kinds of graphics easily ([learn how to use Canva here](https://www.filmora.io/community-blog/how-to-make-a-youtube-banner-for-free-using-canva-116.html)), and they even have templates you can use to make YouTube channel art. Using a template on Canva is as easy as clicking on the one you want and then dragging and dropping in your own images (if you don’t want to use theirs) and changing what the text says.

Although Canva is free to use, and includes many free options for graphics and stock photos, it does also have some premium images and clip art which cost $1 each to use. Making a free banner is as easy as making sure none of the paid elements are in your design (they’re watermarked, so you’ll know).

## 4\. [Fotor](https://www.fotor.com/features/youtube.html)

_In the above video, YouTuber BBelleGames walks you through all of the features you can use to build your channel art in Fotor._

Fotor is another free online drag-n-drop program with YouTube channel art templates. You can create your banner with Fotor in 4 steps. First open the Design feature and choose a template. Second, either choose a design or build one from scratch. Third, overlay images and any text you want over your background. Finally, save your banner and choose a format to export it in.

The free version of Fotor will work well enough for most YouTubers, but you can also upgrade to their paid Pro program to unlock more content and features.

## 5\. [Visme](http://blog.visme.co/youtube-banner-template/)

Visme offers 50 YouTube channel art templates which you can customize the text of for free. You just create a free account, choose the template that best suits your channel, insert your own text and edit that text’s font and color.

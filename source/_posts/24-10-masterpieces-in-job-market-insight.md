## Tips for Creating Awesome Recruitment Videos after Covid-19

It looks like that Covid-19 has changed the face of recruitment overnight. Due to uncertainty in every industry, the effect on recruitment would be no different. The pandemic has shifted a significant workforce in the specific ways that we haven't anticipated. The recommended solution to social distancing places every work environment either at home or in a remote area. Companies are being encouraged to make recruitment videos and post them online. It also speeds up the hiring time while also giving the option of video interviewing.

Let’s learn some useful tips by which your recruitment videos stand out.

#### Include only the right people

Showing just the CEO or Founder of the company will not be helpful to make an awesome recruitment video. That's not the ideal presentation of experience for the candidates. Show them what they want to see, including the employees and overall work environment.

#### Make multiple videos and keep them brief

You must make small video shots and then combine them with [competent video editing software](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/). It would be great to make little videos targeting various kinds of audiences. The next tip is to keep the overall recruitment video short between 2 to 4 minutes only.

#### Use an excellent video editor

Simply creating a video is not enough unless you know to edit it correctly. We recommend **Wondershare Fimora9** video editor for beautiful editing features. It consists of lots of new functions, including advanced editing options as well. None of the recruitment videos is posted online without editing.

#### Include a CTA (Call to Action)

Don't make a video like a lost opportunity. Instead, you should make it a grabbing chance. Have some call-to-action directing a viewer to somewhere valuable. You can even put a link to a landing page on the career site of the company.

#### Extensively promote

Use various kinds of promotion tools and platforms to publish your videos. You can post them on Facebook, YouTube, and well-recognized promotion platforms and attract talented clients. Include the link of those videos in each of your job descriptions. Additionally, you can share such videos with Linkedin and Glassdoor.

#### Include the necessary information

Apart from presenting just the physical environment, you must also share the necessary information for the company. Sometimes, the creator forgets to state the required information in the desire for complicated info. But that's not the solution if you have missed the basics.

### Conclusion

So, this is all about inspiring recruitment videos! We have included all the required information on the concept and the best ten recruiting videos. Reading the post would also help you make amazing recruiting videos that stand out and prove to be action-oriented.

## Method 1\. Make a YouTube Thumbnail on iPhone With the iPhone Photos App

One way to create a thumbnail for your YouTube video on your iPhone is to use the built-in Photos app. The Photos app comes pre-installed on all iPhones and offers a range of editing tools you can use to create a thumbnail.

The Photos app on your iPhone offers a range of features that you can use to create a custom thumbnail for your YouTube video. Here are some of the features you can use:

* **Crop:** The crop tool allows you to resize and reposition your thumbnail image by trimming away any unnecessary parts of the image.
* **Rotate:** The rotate tool lets you adjust the orientation of your thumbnail image. You can rotate the image clockwise or counterclockwise to achieve the desired angle.
* **Adjust lighting and color:** The lighting and color tools allow you to adjust the brightness, contrast, saturation, and other aspects of the thumbnail image to enhance its overall appearance.
* **Add text:** You can use the text tool to add words or phrases to your thumbnail image. This can be a great way to include a call-to-action or to highlight a key feature of your video.
* **Add filters and stickers:** The Photos app includes a range of filters and stickers that you can use to give your thumbnail image a unique look. You can experiment with filters and stickers to find the perfect one for your thumbnail.

To create a thumbnail using the Photos app on your iPhone, follow these steps:

Step1 Open the Photos app and find the image you want to use as your thumbnail. **Tap** on the image to open it.

## It May Interest You â€“ Make YouTube Thumbnails on Windows/Mac

While it's convenient to create YouTube thumbnails on your mobile device, there may be times when you need to create a thumbnail on your Windows or Mac computer.

For example, if you need to create a thumbnail with a higher resolution or more advanced customization options, you may find it easier to do so on a computer. Additionally, a computer may be more efficient if you're working on a larger thumbnail project and need to create multiple thumbnails simultaneously.

One popular tool for creating YouTube thumbnails on a Windows or Mac computer is Filmora. [Wondershare Filmora](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) is a powerful video editing software that allows you to easily edit and enhance your YouTube videos and create custom thumbnails for your videos.

## People Also Ask

Here are some common questions that people have when it comes to creating YouTube thumbnails on mobile.

### Q1\. What App Do Youtubers Use To Make Thumbnails?

There are many different apps and tools that YouTubers use to create thumbnails for their videos. The best app for creating YouTube thumbnails will depend on your needs and skill level.

If you're looking for a quick and easy way to create a thumbnail on your mobile device, start with the built-in Photos app or a third-party app like Canva. If you need more advanced customization options or are comfortable with graphic design software, consider using Adobe Photoshop or another tool.

### Q2\. What Is YouTube Thumbnail Size?

The recommended size for YouTube thumbnails is 1280 x 720 pixels. This size balances quality and file size, ensuring that your thumbnail looks sharp and loads quickly. It's also important to note that YouTube thumbnails are displayed at different sizes depending on the device and context in which they are viewed.

For example, a thumbnail may be displayed at a larger size when it's shown as the main thumbnail for a video but smaller when it's shown in a list of related videos.

### Q3\. What Thumbnail Gets the Most Clicks?

There is no one-size-fits-all answer to this question, as the thumbnail that gets the most clicks can vary depending on the topic of your video, your target audience, and other factors.

However, the key to getting clicks on your thumbnail is to make it visually appealing and relevant to your video. Experiment with different thumbnail designs and track which ones get the most clicks to help you identify what works best for your channel.

## Conclusion

Many tools are available for creating YouTube thumbnails, including the built-in Photos app on mobile devices and third-party apps like Pixelab. One particularly powerful option is Filmora, a video editing software with features for creating custom thumbnails, such as adding text, graphics, and special effects.

Whether you create your thumbnails on your mobile device or your computer, use a high-quality image and make the thumbnail relevant to your video to increase the chances of it getting clicked.

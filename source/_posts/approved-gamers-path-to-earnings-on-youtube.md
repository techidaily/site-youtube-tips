## Part 2: Techno Gamerz YouTube Earning and Stats

Ujjwal Chaurasia, alias Techno Gamerz, was born and grew up in New Delhi, India. The charismatic vlogger first joined YouTube on August 13, 2017, and uploaded his first gaming video on January 2018\. Initially, Ujjwal used his elder brother's phone to post gaming tutorial videos. This obviously limited his input on YouTube as he also had to set aside time for studying.

![techno gamerz youtube marketing](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/techno-gamerz-youtube-income-2022-2.jpg)

##### Step4 Convert the video and upload it on YouTube

If you're satisfied with the edited video, click the **Export** button, then select MP4, WebM, or MP4 AV1 as the target format. Now name your video, choose a folder path, and export it. Remember that you can also directly upload videos on YouTube by clicking the **YouTube** tab.

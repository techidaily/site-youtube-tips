| ![Canon 6D Mark II](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/vlogging-camera-flip-screen-4.png) | Best professional DSLR camera with a flip screen for vlogging: Canon 6D Mark II The 6D Mark II is currently (at the time of writing this review) the only full-frame DSLR camera that comes with both a fully-articulated screen and a microphone jack. It is equipped with a 26.2 MP full-frame CMOS sensor, comes with the DIGIC 7 image processor, and shoots up to full HD 1080p videos at 60 fps. The 6D is also equipped with the same 45-point all cross-phase detection and dual pixel CMOS autofocusing system as the 80D. If youâ€™re wanting to vlog with a full-frame camera, the 6D Mark II is the best option.  **PROS** _\- ISO sensitivity goes up to 102400_ _\- Amazing touchscreen controls_   **CONS** _\- No 4K video recording option_ _\- No USB 3.0_                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |

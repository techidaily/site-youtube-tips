**Elements:**

Filmora has an extensive stock of Elements; with the proper use of Elements in YouTube videos, you can make them engaging and interactive. You already know the importance of interactive videos.

Find multiple elements from the Element section beside the effects and transition section in Filmora.

![filmora elements](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/how-much-money-does-mr.-beast-make-16.jpg)
